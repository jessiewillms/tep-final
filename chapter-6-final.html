                    <p id="kc-1"><span class="span--keyword text--red">Universal public health care,</span> the system all Canadians know and benefit from today, came about as a result of a great deal of deliberate work on the part of citizens, advocacy groups, and policymakers. The Canadian health care system is not perfect by any means, but certainly it is one of the best&mdash;and arguably the best&mdash; in the world. Prior to the late 1940s, before the fight for universal health care began in earnest, access to health care was based solely on one&rsquo;s ability to pay. Most Canadians had no access to health care whatsoever.</p>

                            <p class="text--sans-serif text--bold">Pressure to Implement Universal Health Care</p>
                            <ul class="ul--timeline-sub-ul">
                                <p>The British North America Act of 1867 established the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial governments in delivering health-care services. The division between the two was simple. The larger tax base of the federal government allowed it to exert a strong influence on Canadian health policy, as it continues to do today. The management of health fell to the provinces.</p>
                                <p>From 1880 to the 1950s, there were a variety of pre-payment health plans in place across Canada, sponsored by local governments, industries, and volunteer agencies (Vayda and Deber, 1995), but that was all that was available to average citizens. By 1934, for example, there were twenty-seven hospital-sponsored pre-payment plans in six provinces. Medical associations and hospitals also developed health insurance plans in Ontario, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia. In 1939, the first Canadian Blue Cross plan was formed in Manitoba, with most provinces following suit in the 1940s. But these voluntary plans did not cover all medical services, and were available only to those who could pay the premiums.</p>
                                <p>Provincial governments were slow to move toward universal health care and they only reacted under pressure from non-governmental groups. For example, in British Columbia, relief workers, the One Big Union, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) put intense pressure on the government of Thomas Dufferin (&ldquo;Duff&rdquo;) Pattullo to institute comprehensive health insurance in the 1930s. In 1933, the Pattullo government included health care as a key component of its election platform. The health-care legislation passed a third reading, but because of opposition from doctors, the government refused to enact it. Health insurance plans were also blocked in Alberta by the powerful Alberta Medical Association.</p>

                            <ul class="ul--timeline-sub-ul">
                                <p>The lines of opposition were not always clear-cut even within the field of social work itself. For example, the 1942 Heagerty Report and the 1943 Marsh Report both recommended state-funded health insurance. The Heagerty Report proposed a federally funded, two-stage health insurance scheme. The report received widespread support, including from the labour movement and the Canadian Medical Association, but foundered because of federal-provincial disagreements. The more conservative Social Service Council, on the other hand, led by Ottawa mayor Charlotte Whitton, opposed the idea of state-funded health insurance.</p>
                                <p>The Marsh Report of 1943, which detailed the need for comprehensive and universal social programs, including health care, can be regarded as a critical event in the history of social welfare. Indeed, Canadian historian Michael Bliss described the Marsh Report as &ldquo;the most important single document in the history of the Welfare State in Canada.&rdquo; The report recommended that the country establish a &ldquo;social minimum,&rdquo; a standard aimed at protecting the disadvantaged through policies such as social insurance and children&rsquo;s allowances. By 1966, most of Marsh&rsquo;s recommendations had become law in Canada.</p>

                                <p>In 1947, the first public insurance plan for hospital services was instituted in Saskatchewan. By 1961, all provinces and territories had signed agreements with the federal government for limited, in-patient hospital care with federal cost sharing. In 1962, Saskatchewan was the centre of a hard-fought struggle between the provincial government under the leadership of Tommy Douglas on the one hand, and the medical establishments on the other. The Saskatchewan universal health care program was finally launched by Douglas&rsquo;s successor, Woodrow Lloyd, in 1962.</p>
                                <!-- ./end image -->
                                <p>In 1964, Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker (also from Saskatchewan) appointed Justice Emmett Hall to chair a Royal Commission on Health Care. The resulting <span id="kc-2" class="text--red span--keyword">Hall Report</span> disclosed that 7.5 million Canadians did not have medical coverage and recommended a comprehensive health service patterned on the Saskatchewan model. Women&rsquo;s organizations and organized labour were particularly strong supporters. The Liberal minority government that followed, supported by the newly established New Democratic Party (now led by Tommy Douglas), continued to push for universal health care.</p>
                                <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-3"><em>The Medical Care Act</em></span> was passed in 1968.

                                <p>Subsequently, the <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-4">Canada Health Act</span> (1984) changed the funding structure, prohibited opting out and extra billing, and further strengthed the universal nature of the public health-care system in Canada.</p>

                    <p>In 2001, Allan Rock, the federal Minister of Health, announced the formation of the Royal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, under the leadership of Roy Romanow. Its mandate was to engage Canadians in a national dialogue on the future of health care and to make recommendations to preserve the long-term sustainability of Canada&rsquo;s universally accessible, publicly funded health-care system.</p>
                    <p>The Romanow report has been the backdrop for the major debates and disagreements between the federal and provincial governments over health care in recent years.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Romanow Commission</p>
                    <p>The final report of the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Romanow Commission</span> was released in 2002. In his work, Romanow said he was guided by two things: Canadian values of fairness, equity, and solidarity; and by the evidence. This approach led him to recommend expanding public, not-for-profit <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-6">medicare</span> to include home care and pharmacare, and to introduce a genuine system of primary health care. &ldquo;In the coming months, the choices we make, or the consequences of those we fail to make,&rdquo; declared Romanow in his final report, &ldquo;will decide medicare&rsquo;s future. I believe Canadians are prepared to embark on the journey together and build on the proud legacy they have inherited&rdquo; (Romanow 2002, 247).</p>
                    <p>The Commission&rsquo;s final report, <em>Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada,</em> comprises 47 detailed, costed recommendations. Romanow &lsquo;s recommendations were premised on three main themes: (1) strong leadership is needed to maintain Medicare, (2) the system should become more efficient and responsive, and (3) both short-term and long-term strategies are needed to maintain universal health care. The Commission&rsquo;s report also addressed such diverse issues as Aboriginal health care, culturally sensitive access to health care, and the impact of globalization and applied research on the health of Canadians.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Medicare Under the Microscope</p>
                    <p>Canadians are justifiably proud of the health care system that they have inherited and, by any standards, the system is unique. It is &ldquo;universal&rdquo; insofar as it covers all &ldquo;medically necessary services.&rdquo; Doctors cannot charge individual Canadians for such services, nor are there any private hospitals. Undoubtably, this is what provides Canadians with a sense of personal security and even pride. But just what is &ldquo;medically necessary&rdquo; is unclear. For example, special services (e.g., MRIs, certain blood tests), dental care, drugs required outside the hospital setting, and long-term care&mdash;all medically necessary&mdash;typically involve a fee.</p>
                    <p>Critics of the current system want to increase the private, for-profit component. They want to bring Canadian health care more in line with other models, such as the National Health Service in Britain. They argue that a &ldquo;two-tier system,&rdquo; with private and public medicine offered side by side, will make the system more cost-efficient and provide more medical choices for consumers. There is no such thing as &ldquo;free&rdquo; health care, they argue, it is just a question of who pays.</p>
                    <p> The system&rsquo;s supporters, on the other hand, argue against a two-tier system. If anything, they insist, what is needed are renewed efforts to defend and even extend the system&mdash;to include more &ldquo;medically necessary&rdquo; procedures, not fewer&mdash;and to make it more cost-efficient and more equitable for Canadian citizens.</p>
                    <p>This debate over the future of health care occurs in real time&mdash;major groups align themselves on one side or the other. Who will win out? Time will tell, but the stakes are certainly high.</p>

                    <p>Both the public and the private sectors contribute to the financing of Canada&rsquo;s health system (see Figure 6.1). Public-sector funding includes payments by governments at the federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal levels and by workers&rsquo; compensation boards and other social security schemes. Private-sector funding consists primarily of health expenditures by households and private insurance firms.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Total Health Expenditure in Canada</p>
                    <p>The latest data available put health spending in Canada at approximately $214.9 billion or $6,045 per Canadian (2014). The rate of growth in health spending (2.1 percent in 2014) continues to be less than inflation and population growth combined. Health spending decreased by an average 0.4 percent per year in the previous four years after adjusting for these factors.</p>
                    <p>Since the start of the global economic recession in 2008, the ratio of health spending to GDP has stabilized or fallen in most OECD countries. A new period of slower growth is emerging. It reflects, in large part, Canada&rsquo;s modest economic growth and fiscal restraint as governments focus on balancing budgetary deficits. Health expenditure, on average, accounts for about 40 percent of provincial/territorial government budgets. Hospitals (29.6 percent), drugs (15.8 percent), and physician services (15.5 percent) continue to account for the largest shares of health dollars (more than 60 percent of total health spending).</p>
                    <p>While Canadians aged 65 and over account for less than 15 percent of the Canadian population, they consume more than 45 percent of all public-sector health dollars spent.</p>

                    <p>Health spending per person varies among provinces and territories. Total health spending per person is highest in Newfoundland and Labrador ($6,953) and Alberta ($6,783) and lowest in Qu&eacute;bec ($5,616) and British Columbia ($5,865). The amount spent per person reflects the population of each province and territory and its health-care needs, as well as the organization of health services, personnel compensation, and the sharing of costs between public and private sectors. Per person spending on health might be expected to be higher in the territories due to their small, dispersed populations. Hospitals (29.6 percent), drugs (15.8 percent) and physician services (15.5 percent) continue to account for the largest shares of health dollars (more than 60 percent of total health spending). Although spending continues to grow in all three categories, the pace has slowed in recent years.</p>

                    <p>In reality, &ldquo;free&rdquo; health care does not exist anywhere; it is a question of who pays how much, and for what services. However, the case for some form of publicly funded health care is accepted by most countries in the world. Apart from being an effective delivery method, public medicare has important advantages over a private health care system.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">First, public financing spreads the cost of health care across society, rather than only to those who are unfortunate or sick.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Second, financing health insurance through taxation is efficient, since it does not require the creation of a separate collection process.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Third, medicare encourages Canadians to seek preventive care services and to treat problems before they worsen and treatment becomes more costly.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Fourth, the government can cut costs, as it is largely a single buyer of health care supplies and services.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many Canadian businesses also recognize and support Canada&rsquo;s universal medicare system. Lower employee benefit costs and a healthy and mobile workforce are competitive advantages. Also, the portability principle of medicare ensures that workers can move from province to province and still be covered by health insurance. Provincial governments have also begun to address preventive medicine and community-based care.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Public vs. Private Health Care</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, public health care in Canada is not entirely secure. An aging population and ever-spiralling costs will require defenders of universal care to be even more alert. Some of the potential dangers are indicated below.</p>
                    <li class="li--bullet"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Universality.</span> One of the biggest threats to our public system of health care is the current movement to privatize care in some provinces, particularly in Alberta and Ontario. Saskatchewan recently passed legislation that allows patients to pay privately for MRIs. Qu&eacute;bec also introduced legislation that will allow physicians to bill for a range of &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; products and services, ranging from eye drops to colonoscopies. Several trends indicate increased <span class="text--bold text--red" id="kc-7">privatization</span> in our health care system:</li>
                    
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet li--sub-list-item">the &ldquo;de-listing&rdquo; of services covered by medicare (e.g., specific medical procedures, support services, and drugs)</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet li--sub-list-item">the transferring of care out of areas covered by medicare (e.g., acute care in hospitals) to areas that are not (e.g., home care)</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet li--sub-list-item">the contracting out of &ldquo;non-core&rdquo; medical services (laboratories, ambulances, and rehabilitation services) to private firms</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                        <li class="li--bullet"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Comprehensiveness. </span> Some provinces have attempted to reduce costs by reducing comprehensiveness&mdash;that is, the range of what are considered to be &ldquo;medically necessary&rdquo; services. Because the Canada Health Act states that the provinces should determine which services are &ldquo;medically necessary,&rdquo; there is some room for provinces to limit that range.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Contracting out.</span> There are also concerns regarding the administration of hospitals.

The Commonwealth Fund ranks health care in 11 Western countries and gives the nod to the U.K., followed by Switzerland, Sweden, Australia and Germany.</p>
                                        <p>The problem with these exercises is that no one can really agree on what should be measured and, even when they do settle on measures, data are not always reliable and comparable. &ldquo;Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect health system and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t reside in any one country,&rdquo; Mark Britnell, global chairman for health at the consulting giant KPMG, writes in his new book, In Search of the Perfect Health System. &ldquo;But there are fantastic examples of great health and health care from around the world which can offer inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>As a consultant who has worked in 60 countries&mdash;and who receives in-depth briefings on the health systems of each before meeting clients&mdash;Mr. Britnell has a unique perspective and, in the book, offers up a subjective and insightful list of the traits that are important to creating good health systems.</p>
                                        <p>If the world had a perfect health system, he writes, it would have the following qualities: the values and universal access of the U.K.; the primary care of Israel; the community services of Brazil; the mental-health system of Australia; the health promotion philosophy of the Nordic countries; the patient and community empowerment in parts of Africa; the research and development infrastructure of the United States; the innovation, flair and speed of India; the information, communications and technology of Singapore; the choice offered to patients in France; the funding model of Switzerland; and the care for the aged of Japan.</p>
                                        <p>In the book, Mr. Britnell elaborates on each of these examples of excellence and, in addition, provides a great pr&eacute;cis of the strengths and weaknesses of health systems in 25 countries. The chapter on Canada is appropriately damning, noting that this country&rsquo;s outmoded health system has long been ripe for revolution, but the &ldquo;revolution has not happened.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>Why? Because this country has a penchant for doing high-level, in-depth reviews of the health system&rsquo;s problems, but puts all its effort into producing recommendations and none into implementing them. Ouch. &ldquo;Canada stands at a crossroads,&rdquo; Mr. Britnell writes, &ldquo;and needs to find the political will and managerial and clinical skills to establish a progressive coalition of the willing.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>The book&rsquo;s strength is that it does not offer up simplistic solutions. Rather, it stresses that there is no single best approach because all health systems are the products of their societies, norms and cultures. One of the best parts of the book&mdash;and quite relevant to Canada&mdash;is the analysis of funding models. &ldquo;The debate about universal health care is frequently confused with the ability to pay,&rdquo; Mr. Britnell writes. He notes that the high co-payments in the highly praised health systems of Asia would simply not be tolerated in the West.</p>
                                        <p>But ultimately what matters is finding an approach that works, not a perfect one: &ldquo;This is the fundamental point. There is no such thing as free health care; it is only a matter of who pays for it. Politics is the imperfect art of deciding who gets what, how and when.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>The book stresses that the challenges are the same everywhere: providing high-quality care to all at an affordable price, finding the work force to deliver that care and empowering patients. To do so effectively, you need vision and you need systems.</p>
                                        <p>Above all, you need the political will to learn from others and put in place a system that works.</p>

                                        <p>The primary factors that shape the health of Canadians are not medical treatments or lifestyle choices but rather the living conditions they experience. These conditions have come to be known as the social determinants of health.The importance to health of living conditions was established in the mid-1800s and has been enshrined in Canadian government policy documents since the mid-1970s. In fact, Canadian contributions to the social determinants of health concept have been so extensive as to make Canada a &ldquo;health promotion powerhouse&rdquo; in the eyes of the international health community. Recent reports from Canada&rsquo;s Chief Public Health Officer, the Canadian Senate, and the Public Health Agency of Canada continue to document the importance of the social determinants of health.</p>
                                        <p>But this information&mdash;based on decades of research and hundreds of studies in Canada and elsewhere&mdash;tells a story that is unfamiliar to most Canadians. Canadians are largely unaware that our health is shaped by how income and wealth are distributed, whether or not we are employed, and if so, the working conditions we experience.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, our well-being is also determined by the health and social services we receive, and our ability to obtain quality education, food, and housing, among other factors. And contrary to the assumption that Canadians have personal control over these factors, in most cases these living conditions are&mdash;for better or worse&mdash;imposed upon us by the quality of the communities, housing situations, our work settings, health and social service agencies, and educational institutions with which we interact.</p>
                                        <p>There is much evidence that the quality of the social determinants of health Canadians experience helps explain the wide health inequalities that exist among Canadians.</p>

                                        <p>The same goes for the health of their children: diifferences among Canadian children in their surviving beyond their first year of life, experiencing childhood afflictions such as asthma and injuries, and whether they fall behind in school are strongly related to the social determinants of health they experience.</p>
                                        <p>Research is also finding that the quality of these health-shaping living conditions is strongly determined by decisions that governments make in a range of different public policy domains.</p>
                                        <p>Governments at the municipal, provincial/territorial, and federal levels create policies, laws, and regulations that influence how much income Canadians receive through employment, family benefits, or social assistance, the quality and availability of affordable housing, the kinds of health and social services and recreational opportunities we can access, and even what happens when Canadians lose their jobs during economic downturns.</p>
                                        <p>These experiences also provide the best explanations for how Canada compares to other nations in overall health.</p>
                                        <p>Canadians generally enjoy better health than Americans, but do not do as well compared to other nations that have developed public policies that strengthen the social determinants of health. The World Health Organization sees health-damaging experiences as resulting from &ldquo;a toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics&rdquo;.</p>

                                        <p>Despite this evidence, there has been little effort by Canadian governments and policymakers to improve the social determinants of health through public policy action. Canada compares unfavourably to other wealthy developed nations in its support of citizens as they navigate the life span. Our income inequality and poverty rates are growing and are among the highest of wealthy developed nations. Canadian spending in support of families, persons with disabilities, older Canadians, and employment training is also among the lowest of these same wealthy developed nations</p>
                                        <p>Improving the health of Canadians is possible but requires Canadians to think about health and its determinants in a more sophisticated manner than has been the case to date.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">A study of 220,000 Canadians found that health problems affect four major ethnic groups at different rates</p>
                                        <p>It is widely known that rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure are on the rise. But a new Canadian study shows that certain ethnic groups&mdash;specifically, South Asian men and Black men and women&mdash;get these chronic health problems more often than the rest of the population.</p>
                                        <p>The study, published on Monday [August 10, 2015] in the journal BMJ Open, found that overall, the heart health of South Asian men and Black people in Canada has deteriorated significantly in the past decade. For instance, diabetes in South Asian men has doubled to more than 15 percent of the population in 2012 from 6.7 percent in 2001.</p>
                                        <p>Among Black women, the rate of diabetes grew to just over 12&#8239;percent from 6.3 percent during that same time period. Rates of obesity rose in each of the ethnic groups studied, but the largest increases were found in Black and Chinese men. Given that obesity is often a precursor to chronic health problems, these findings should be sounding an alarm, said Dr.&#8239;Maria Chiu, scientist at Toronto&rsquo;s Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and lead author of the study. The obesity trends &ldquo;paint a really scary picture&rdquo; of what could happen to type 2 diabetes rates in the future, she said.</p>
                                        <p>The study looked at data from nearly 220,000 Canadians who took part in Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Canadian Community Health Survey. The researchers focused on individuals belonging to Canada&rsquo;s four major ethnic groups: white, South Asian, Chinese, and Black.</p>
                                        <p>The results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting health problems affect ethnic groups at different rates. While genes certainly play a role, they do not tell the entire story, Chiu said. &ldquo;I like to think of it as genes load up the gun and environment pulls the trigger,&rdquo; she said.</p>
                                        <p>Her study helps explain why some ethnic groups appear to be more vulnerable to certain health conditions. Overall, the ethnic minority groups included in the study had household incomes that were as much as $30,000 lower than those of their white counterparts.</p>
                                        <p>Those groups also reported that they ate fewer fruits and vegetables. At the same time, smoking rates among all of the groups studied fell, with the exception of Black women and Chinese men.</p>
                                        <p>&ldquo;This is another wakeup call,&rdquo; said Dr. Sonia Anand, professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton and a spokeswoman for the Heart and Stroke Foundation. &ldquo;We have to get going or we&rsquo;re going to end up with an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the next 20 years.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>Anand was not involved in this study, but much of her research focuses on the causes of heart disease in ethnic groups. She said the evidence is clear the differences exist, but there is no clear strategy on how to solve this complex problem.</p>
                                        <p>The important question for researchers and policy makers, according to Chiu, is how to bridge the gap and reverse the trends.</p>
                                        <p>One solution will be to tailor campaigns to ethnic groups, Chiu said. They need to know they are at risk and what changes they can make to reduce their vulnerability, such as quitting smoking or eating more fruits and vegetables.</p>
                                        <p>And, as Anand noted, &ldquo;we move less, we commute by car, we don&rsquo;t live in walkable neighbourhoods.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>That means the necessary solutions are going to require a lot of time, co-ordination, funding and commitment, she said.</p>

                    <p class="text--caption">Community Care Access Centres (CCACs), which were set up in 1996 to co-ordinate access to home and community care services, will be wound down starting in 2016.

                    <p>The idea of community-based health care as an alternative to individual physician care has existed since early in the twentieth century, with the first examples appearing in the United Kingdom and the United States. Canada&rsquo;s first community-based centre&mdash;the Mount Carmel Clinic in Winnipeg&mdash;opened over 90 years ago, in 1926, and is still in operation. Ontario&rsquo;s first <span class="text--red" id="kc-9">community health centre (CHC)</span> opened in Sault Ste. Marie in 1963.</p>
                    <p>Each province currently offers its own unique collection of community-based organizations and access points for health care in their province. Among the services offered are: primary care, maternity care, home support, family care clinics, community care access centres, Aboriginal health centres, family health teams, nurse practitioner-led clinics, <span class="text--red" id="kc-12">interdisciplinary teams</span>, midwifery, and community-based palliative care.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Advantageous Role of Community Health Centres</p>
                    <p>The <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-10">Canadian Association of Community Health Centres</span> is the federal voice for community health centres and community-oriented, people-centred primary health care across Canada. The association was established in 2012 to replace the previous Canadian Alliance of Community Health Centre Associations, which was first established in 1995. Once considered the &ldquo;poor cousins&rdquo; of the mainstream health-care system (because of their association with low-income and disadvantaged populations), CHCs have grown in number and size as provincial governments recognize their role in preventative medicine and health promotion. Since the mid-1980s, they have offered an ever-broadening range of client services to the general public, as well as to parents, seniors, women, and ethnic and immigrant populations.</p>
                    <p>The underlying premise of the CHC system is that community residents, in partnership with providers and funders of health services, need to be involved in identifying the needs of their community and in designing and overseeing service delivery, and evaluating health services programs. CHCs tend to network with other health and social services agencies and are accountable to their communities through community boards. They operate on the principle that communities should work together to &ldquo;own&rdquo; health care services. They frequently address issues pertaining to the social determinants of health, such as housing, literacy, and poverty through programs and social action.</p>
                    <p>CHCs are funded primarily by provincial grants. Additional funding is often obtained from the United Way, other foundations, and federal government programs. Funding is allocated either through a global budgeting process, based on services directed at populations, or through capitalization funding, where fixed sums are established for each registered client based on need as a reflection of age, sex, key demographic factors, and prevalence and severity of chronic illness. The use of CHCs (centres locaux des services communautaires) is most widespread in Qu&eacute;bec. Ontario comes second. There is, however, a growing interest in the CHC model across the country, both as a way to cut costs and as a community-based approach.</p>
                    <p>An important advantage of the CHC model is the focus on prevention, education, community development, social action, and health promotion. CHCs tend to address four main determinants of health&mdash;living and working conditions, available social support, individual behaviour, and genetic makeup. Located as they are between the patient and medical practitioners, social workers are central to the provision of both direct care and community development in the CHC model of health-care delivery.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Canada needs to find a solution to serious regional health inequalities</p>
                                        <p>Canadians, on average, are fairly healthy. Life expectancy continues to rise, fewer of us smoke and more of us are becoming physically active. That&rsquo;s the problem with averages. They are misleading. In Ontario, for instance, average life expectancy is 81.5 years&mdash;a pretty decent number. It&rsquo;s only when you look beyond the big picture that you see the cracks. The life expectancy of a baby born in Brampton is 84. A child born the same day in Sault Ste. Marie, less than 700 kilometres away, is 79.</p>
                                        <p>Another telling metric is potentially avoidable deaths&mdash;how many people likely died unnecessarily because they didn&rsquo;t receive proper care after a heart attack, weren&rsquo;t vaccinated against a disease, or suffered another preventable or treatable ailment. According to the Ontario average, 163 in 100,000 people die from a potentially avoidable death a year. But in reality, the numbers vary wildly across the province, from a low of 114 per 100,000 in cities such as Richmond Hill and Vaughan, to a high of 258 in Thunder Bay, Marathon, Dryden and the surrounding area.</p>
                                        <p>These numbers are from a report released last week by Health Quality Ontario, a provincial agency mandated to improve the province&rsquo;s health care system. But this isn&rsquo;t just an Ontario problem. Across the country, the situation is much the same: startling, persistent regional health inequalities that, quite literally, are sickening and killing countless Canadians before their time.</p>
                                        <p>Often, stark inequalities exist between urban and rural or remote communities, which is why northern parts of the country are so often struck by much higher rates of disease and premature death. There are many reasons behind these differences, such as the fact that in northern communities, people tend to smoke more, be less physically active, have a much more difficult time accessing specialized medical care, have higher Aboriginal populations and have lower education and income levels compared with large urban centres. Of course, many of these same problems can be found within cities, where pockets of vulnerable individuals can live just a few blocks from affluence.</p>
                                        <p>But none of this explains why we as Canadians have allowed these problems to persist for so long. Why we consider it acceptable that, depending on where you live, how much you earn or what education level you have achieved, you are much more likely to die from a chronic illness or have to wait weeks longer for a loved one to get a spot in a long-term care home.</p>
                                        <p>The answer, quite possibly, is that many of us have never really stopped to consider that these differences exist. That, in 2015, Aboriginal peoples in Canada are being infected with and dying of tuberculosis. Or that many patients with chronic diseases living outside of urban centres often have few resources to help them manage their conditions. Or that many communities throughout Canada face crippling doctor shortages that close emergency rooms and delay treatment.</p>
                                        <p>Joshua Tepper, president and CEO of Health Quality Ontario, says that many people simply don&rsquo;t &ldquo;understand how dramatically different health outcomes are across the province.&rdquo; After all, most politicians and policy-makers live in and around the urban areas where health outcomes tend to be the best. It&rsquo;s all too easy to forget about the people living in remote cities or rural areas.</p>
                                        <p>Some will argue that it&rsquo;s up to people to take charge of their own health. That&rsquo;s true. But when the realities of daily life set them up for failure, it&rsquo;s a sign that change is needed from a higher level. An excellent example of this is cited by Connie Clement, scientific director of the National Collaborating Centre for Determinants of Health. She notes that the Liquor Control Board of Ontario is able to tightly regulate the price of alcohol throughout the province. Yet nothing is done about the fact that milk or fresh produce can be priced so high that few families in remote communities can afford them.</p>
                                        <p>It&rsquo;s heartening to hear experts such as Tepper and Clement put these serious health inequality issues on the table. Now, it&rsquo;s up to the politicians and policy-makers to listen up and pledge to do something about it. Canada needs to find a solution to serious regional health inequalities.</p>

                                        <p>With the death of Premier Maurice Duplessis in 1959 and the election of the Liberal government under Jean Lesage (shown here) in 1960, Qu&eacute;bec entered what is generally referred to as the Quiet Revolution. This period was marked by a radical transformation of Qu&eacute;bec society in which the State took over control of health and social services.</p>
                                        <p>Up to the time of the Quiet Revolution, at least for the French-speaking population of Qu&eacute;bec, health and social services were under the control of the Catholic Church.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Castonguay-Nepveu Report</p>
                                        <p>In 1966, Premier Jean Lesage mandated Claude Castonguay and G&eacute;rard Nepveu to chair a commission of inquiry into health and welfare (Commission d&rsquo;enqu&ecirc;te sur la sant&eacute; et le bien-&ecirc;tre social, CESBES).</p>
                                        <p> The report, known as the Castonguay-Nepveu Report, was published in 1970 and provided a blueprint for the reorganization of health and social services in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
                                        <p>As a first step, the Qu&eacute;bec government, under Premier Robert Bourassa, created the Ministry of Social Affairs (Minist&egrave;re des affaires sociales) and appointed Claude Castonguay as its first minister.</p>
                                        <p>Then, in 1971, even before the ink on the Castonguay-Nepveu Report was dry, the Qu&eacute;bec government passed a law (la Loi sur les services de sant&eacute; et les services sociaux) commonly known as Bill 65. This law called for six structures:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">regional health and social service councils, les conseils r&eacute;gioneaux de la sant&eacute; et des services sociaux, CRSSS;</li>

                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">local community service centres, les centres locaux de services communautaires, CLSC.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-191" class="ch-link">Three New Structures and Twleve New Regions</a></p>
                                        <p>As stated in the law (Bill 65), each of the structures were to be administered by a board of directors that was required to include community representation.</p>
                                        <p>Three of these structures&mdash;namely the residential centres, the hospital centres, and the social service centres&mdash;already existed, while the regional health and social service councils, the community health departments, and the local community service centres were totally new structures.</p>
                                        <p>The Qu&eacute;bec Government divided the provinces into twelve regions, each of which would be administered by a regional health and social service council (CRSSS) whose role it was to organize the health and social services programs based on the needs of the population within its region. The community health departments were integrated within the hospital centres and were responsible for epidemiological studies on health concerns and the evaluation of programs with a focus on preventative care.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Innovative Nature of the CLSCs</p>
                                        <p>The most innovative of the new structures was the CLSCs. Qu&eacute;bec, which has been described by Shah and Moloughney (2001), as being in the forefront in the development of community health centres in Canada, created the CLSCs to provide a multi-service &ldquo;one-stop&rdquo; agency for the provision of basic health and social services throughout the province.</p>
                                        <p>As explained by Ives, Denov, and Sussman (2015, p. 47), &ldquo;CLSCs were mandated to provide the delivery of preventative, restorative and ongoing health and social services at home, school, work or in a clinic to older adults with loss of autonomy, at-risk children and families, persons with physical disabilities, children with learning disabilities, persons living with mental health challenges, and persons in need of family physicians.&rdquo; However, as stated by Gaumer and Fleury (2008), the development of the CLSCs was not without controversy. Many of the CLSCs in the various communities evolved from the grass-roots initiatives of community organizers who wanted to maintain community control.</p>
                                        <p>&ldquo;Although few in number, the community organizers were to play a particularly important role in developing and supporting community organizations, and the CLSCs emerged as bona fide laboratories for social innovation especially when they were first created&rdquo; (p. 91).</p>
                                        <p>During the mid-1970s, some Qu&eacute;bec politicians were nevertheless concerned about the role of the community organizers, suggesting that the CLSCs had become sites of left-wing protests and &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">New Health and Social Service Networks</p>
                                        <p>In response, the Government launched l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ration bilan and commissioned a panel of experts to evaluate the functioning of the CLSCs. Robert Mayer (2002) explained that the formal report of l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ration bilan, which included the majority of the panel members, recommended that the CLSCs should spend less time engaging in social activism and more on providing basic health and social services to be offered by multidisciplinary teams of professionals. At the same time, a smaller dissenting group of panelists prepared a minority report and insisted that the CLSCs should &ldquo;at all cost&rdquo; preserve its social action role (ibid., p. 296).</p>
                                        <p>By the early part of the 1980s, the Qu&eacute;bec Government, trying to regain control, gradually forced the CLSCs to tailor their services to the unique needs of each local community but standardize their practices and focus on priority areas such as home care for the elderly and mental health. For example, in the Qu&eacute;bec City region, the CLSCs were the only organizations to offer psycho-social counselling for people living with mental health problems (Gaumer and Fleury, 2008).</p>
                                        <p>More recently, in 2005, the CLSCs lost even more of their autonomy when the Qu&eacute;bec Government passed a new law, la Loi modifiant la Loi sur les services de sant&eacute; et les services sociaux, or Bill 83, that modified the 1971 law and grouped health and social services into eighteen regions to be administered by Health and Social Service Networks, Centres de sant&eacute; et de services sociaux, CSSS.</p>
                                        <p>In each of these regions, the CLSCs, residential long-term centres, and general and specialized hospital centres were merged and were required to co-ordinate their services with other suppliers in the regions (Gaumer and Fleury, 2008). As explained by Ives, et al. (2015), today the 147 CLSCs continue to serve as the point of entry for the Qu&eacute;bec population to the Health and Social Service Networks.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the Indian Act, the federal government has declared self-appointed jurisdiction over Indigenous peoples&rsquo; health care. The health status of some Indigenous peoples lags far behind that of other Canadians. Some communuities are healthy and thriving, but others face many challenges, often stemming from the residual impacts of colonization. </p>
                        <p>The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) points out that the <span class="text--red">health gap:</span> between First Nations people and the general population is widening. Sixty-two percent of adult Canadians over the age of 15 reported their health as being excellent or very good, whereas only 58 percent of M&eacute;tis, 53 percent of First Nations people living off reserve, and 50 percent of Inuit adults identify their health as excellent or very good (Canadian Community Health Survey, 2005; Aboriginal People&rsquo;s Survey, 2006).</p>
                        <!-- image here -->
                        <p>The AFN&rsquo;s Health Secretariat, the National First Nations Health Technicians Network (NFNHTN), and the Chiefs Committee on Health (CCOH) have identified seven health priorities in relation to closing the health gap:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet">sustainability</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">health research</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">jurisdictional issues</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">mental health</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">children&rsquo;s health/gender health</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">smoking, and</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">environmental health and infrastructure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These priorities have been, and continue to be, urgent.</p>
                        <p>The prevalence of risk factors and chronic conditions varies significantly between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations, with Aboriginal people generally having less favorable outcomes. Obesity and being overweight, for example, are more common among Aboriginal people. Also, the likelihood of having at least one chronic condition and conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes is higher among Aboriginal people, even when sociodemographic characteristics are taken into account.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Importance of Traditional Indigenous Approaches to Health and Healing</p>
                        <p>Current health disparities are linked to the historical impacts of colonization and cannot be understood in isolation from the structural determinants of health. Insufficient funding for Indigenous programs and services, inadequate health system infrastructure in Indigenous communities, economic exclusion, and educational inequities along with overcrowded housing, particularly in remote communities, affect the overall social determinants of community health (Greenwood et al., 2015).</p>
                        <p>As one of 94 calls to action, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2015) has urged the federal government to establish mechanisms to narrow the health-care gap between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, including building Aboriginal healing practices into the health-care system and spending more on Aboriginal healing centres.</p>
                        <p>While improvements in health-care services have eased this situation somewhat, they have also contributed to the gradual erosion of traditional Indigenous holistic approaches to health and healing. Indigenous leaders wish to see an integrated, holistic, interdepartmental, and interorganizational strategy to address the inequities in health and social service delivery. They believe that jurisdictional issues between the federal and provincial governments with respect to responsibility for Indigenous health care need to be removed.</p>

                    <p>Indigenous peoples of Canada have harvested and eaten traditional food sources from the land, water, and air since the time of creation. These traditional foods provide ample nourishment to support optimal health and have been of fundamental importance to culture. Eating patterns depended on seasons and where people lived: coastal peoples ate seafood, inland peoples ate game foods and, in other regions of Canada and the Midwest, communities relied heavily on corn, beans, and squash.</p>
                    <p>Today, dietary patterns are much different compared to those in previous generations, which is one factor contributing to poor health outcomes for Canada&rsquo;s Indigenous population. Land dispossession, poverty, environmental contaminants, climate change, and food insecurity have all had a significant impact on dietary patterns and access to traditional foods.</p>
                    <p>Indigenous Food Sovereignty is the right of peoples, communities, and countries to define their own agricultural, labour, fishing, food, and land policies, which are ecologically, socially, spiritually, economically, and culturally appropriate to their unique circumstances. The First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) in British Columbia has developed Healthy Food Guidelines for First Nations Communities, not only to guide First Nations communities in making better food choices, but also to begin to regain sovereignty over their food systems. Participation in harvesting activities such as gathering berries, hunting, or fishing, and eating traditional foods at social and cultural events nourish bodies and spirits while protecting against illness. Another way to change the nutrition environment that has proved successful is to bring people together to participate in community gardens.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Advocating on behalf of clients and for a more effective health-care system</p>
                                        <p> Medical social work practice is wide-ranging. It includes direct casework, group work, discharge planning, family consultation, patient advocacy, counselling for terminally ill patients, training of other professionals, and policy and administration. Almost every hospital in Canada has social workers employed in its departments, including emergency services, oncology, pediatrics, surgery, intensive care, rehabilitation, gerontology, and orthopedics.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers in the health-care field not only work with the immediate impact of disease, injury, disability, and trauma but also with the integration of the client with the support system. This work is complex and multifaceted&mdash;incorporating education, team building, and relationship enhancement</p>
                                        <p>Social work health practitioners generally are required to hold a graduate degree in the field, such as a Master&rsquo;s degree in social work.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Achieving Better Outcomes for Clients</p>
                                        <p>The social worker&rsquo;s main goal is to assist the client so they can get the help and care they need prior to their recovery, adaptation, and return home. They help the client through the support system, provide education related to clients&rsquo; health concerns, and facilitate communication with other health professionals, particularly as they deal with issues of grief, depression, sadness, and anxiety.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers typically will scan the client&rsquo;s environment both inside and outside the hospital facility, on the lookout for helpful people, organizations and programs, and helping the client and system meet current and predicted future needs. The worker may negotiate with specific health-care providers on behalf of their client to ensure the best service for their client.</p>
                                        <p>The social worker will also work more generally with the hospital to build client-supportive programs and policies, taking part in ethics initiatives, group development, proposal writing for new program funding, and other such tasks.</p>
                                        <p>In the hospital context, social workers work with other professional groups with skills and values that may differ from their own (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc). There are times when social workers mediate conflict, intervene in crises, or counsel and educate clients, family, and team members.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Assessing Client Needs</p>
                                        <p>This is one of the most rewarding aspects of social work in the health-care field. A well put-together assessment and plan for moving forward can help a social worker assess all elements of concern to the client, select the best intervention point, and plan an effective strategy to enhance the client&rsquo;s health and well-being.</p>
                                        <p>The psychosocial and environmental factors that social workers take into account when performing a needs assessments of a client are listed below:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What is troubling the client?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What social, health, and education services are available to this client and their family?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Are there other systems that exist nearby but which are not available to the client?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s employment, level of education, and income?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What are the client&rsquo;s financial resources?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Is the client&rsquo;s housing adequate and affordable? What is their neighbourhood like?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">How much stress is the client coping with and are they coping well?</li>

                                            <li class="li--bullet">Does the client have a secure source of food?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Is the client connected with a social network including family, friends, and others?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What was the client&rsquo;s childhood like?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s age?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s ethnic backgroundl?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">What is the client&rsquo;s gender/sexual identity?</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">How is the client&rsquo;s overall health? Are they living with a disability?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The social worker&rsquo;s psychosocial assessment will include these considerations, in addition to other key components such as the client&rsquo;s unique emotional, social, physical, and cognitive context. When a social worker carefully documents and analyzes these aspects of a person&rsquo;s life and their health status, the relationship and interaction between the elements can be seen more clearly.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-195" class="ch-link">Interdisciplinary Team Work</a></p>
                                        <p>In a hospital setting, the social worker is often a member of an interdisciplinary team that includes members of other health professions, such as general medicine, nursing, nutrition, phsyiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychiatry.</p>
                                        <p>The role of social workers is becoming more central in this holistic approach to health and healing, which addresses not only the physical aspects of health, which have commonly been addressed by physicians and nurses, but also the social, cultural, mental, and spiritual aspects. Social workers in such teams possess a distinct skill and value set. Their primary role is to prepare and represent the client at team meetings with other team members. They often throw new light on a situation to help the health-care facility provide even better care for their clients. Their goals might include helping a client do the following:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Cope with a new diagnosis, such as diabetes or cancer</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Face and cope with a diagnosis of a terminal illness</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Enter a parenting role successfully</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Interface with providers of long-term care</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">Adjust to being discharged from hospital and benefit from appropriate post-discharge supports for recovery</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work in Other Health-Care Settings</p>
                                        <p>In addition to hospital work, social workers are involved in other health-care settings, such as hospices, local medical clinics, community health centres, and specialized care agencies (such as HIV/AIDS clinics, substance use disorder treatment centres, family planning, prenatal care, long-term care, home care, nursing homes, and services for people with disabilities).</p>
                                        <p>Keenly aware of the social determinants of health, social workers are also active as health promoters, community developers, and policy advocates in the field of health care. For example, a social worker may work with a community health centre to promote a particular aspect of healthy living in the community. Through this work, social workers are at the forefront in addressing a preventative approach to primary health care, health promotion, and client self-care.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers are also among the staunchest supporters and advocates of universal health care. Efficiencies and improvements are definitely needed to secure medicare and to make it work better for Canadians, but such changes must be made in the context of continuing efforts to ensure full access to quality health care for all citizens of Canada.</p>

                        <p>One of the primary roles of social workers in hospitals is discharge planning. Ensuring that patients are discharged from hospital in a timely manner with appropriate supports in place once they return home requires numerous skills. Social workers must be able to</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet">work cooperatively with other staff as part of a multidisciplinary treatment team,</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">apply sharp analytical and assessment skills,</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">communicate clearly, patiently, and compassionately with patients and staff,</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">initiate a therapeutic relationship with the patient in a timely manner,</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">process paperwork efficiently, and</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet">advocate for the patient&rsquo;s best interests.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Discharging a patient may involve ensuring that home care services or other follow-up services are set up. An individual&rsquo;s discharge can become complicated, for example, when dealing with a previously homeless person with multiple psychosocial and addictions issues. Perhaps a bereaved couple have lost a child and will require either follow-up grief counselling or marital counselling. Or perhaps an older adult cannot return home but must be put on a waiting list for transfer to an assisted-living facility. Sometimes even simple issues need attention; for example, a patient&rsquo;s discharge could be delayed because they do not have a winter coat.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Facilitating Post-Hospitalization Recovery and Supports</p>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, a team approach is used increasingly in health care to ensure that each patient&rsquo;s needs are being met as completely and effectively as possible. This approach can prove beneficial during a patient&rsquo;s hosptial discharge planning stage as well.</p>
                        <p>Social workers bring a unique perspective to health care in this respect. Their assessments help establish a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; context for each individual&rsquo;s life circumstances, and their empathy, insights, and recommendations can increase chances for recovery. Many patients are living with concerns about employment, housing, child rearing, marginalization, social supports, and, most of all, poverty. Affordable, high-quality child care, employment insurance for part-time workers or workers suddenly faced with a disability, improved working conditions for those in high-stress, low-income positions, and increases in affordable housing&mdash;all these factors have a direct effect on health outcomes. Social workers are especially aware of the importance of such factors on wellness and they are prepared and able to address them in the interests of their clients, some of whom may be overwhelmed at the prospect of returning home after a period of hospitalization.</p>
                        <p>In Sam&rsquo;s story, a young man undergoes a traumatic injury and loses the use of his legs. His initial reaction to this loss is one of intense anxiety verging on panic, followed by bouts of anger and depression. The hospital social worker called in to support the man and his young family must first support them in coming to terms with their grief. The social worker then helps the family adapt to their changed circumstances, avail themselves of financial and community supports, and move forward with a sense of renewed hope for their future.</p>

                        <div class="_wrapper--inner">
                            <div class="grid--full cf">
                                <p>Sam, 35, is an avid motorcyclist. One spring evening, he and his friends were out riding in a rural area and it started to rain. The roads were slippery and Sam’s cycle went out of control and hit a bridge abutment. Once safely in hospital, Sam underwent a series of tests. He had no sensation in his arms or legs. After being referred to the rehabilitation team for assessment, he began to recover sensation and use of his arms but none in his legs. It was at that time that Richard, the team’s social worker, was called into the case.</p>
                                <p>Richard met with Sam to conduct a psychosocial assessment. Apart from the recent injury, Sam was in good physical health. He was married and he and his wife Sue had two young children, Alyson, 3, and Jake, 4. Sam’s mother and father were retired and lived nearby. Sam and his family lived in a modest home with a mortgage in the suburbs of a large city.</p>
                                <p>Sam worked in construction as a bricklayer but during the winter he was not always able to find work. Sam also volunteered at a local public school coaching children in volleyball. Sue had returned to school to complete a degree in accounting. Sam played an active role as a father, tending to the needs of the children while his wife attended classes in the evenings. Sue was usually at home with the children during the day. When Sam was working and Sue had academic assignments to do during the day, his parents or a babysitter cared for the children.</p>
                                <p>Sam was experiencing an intense emotional reaction to the accident. He described his anxiety as “skyrocketing“ when the rehabilitation team and his doctor concluded that Sam would not likely regain the use of his lower body. He panicked about his possible inability to work to support his family, especially while his wife completed her studies. He was also worried about his current inability to control his bowel and bladder functions and the possible effect of his disability on his sexual functioning. He faced many problems in the face of these drastic changes in his life and their implications for his family’s future.</p>
                                <p>Richard began by working directly with Sam to provide him with emotional support, encouraging Sam to talk about his sadness, grief, and anger. After a few weeks, Sam’s emotions became less volatile. Together, Richard and Sam identified the issues in Sam’s life that needed the most urgent intervention. They decided to prioritize Sam’s strong desire to get back to work. As a result, he increased time spent with the occupational therapist and the physiotherapist so he could build up his capacity to return to some form of work. The rehabilitation team worked with Sam for several months.</p>
                                <p>Richard and Sam began to focus specifically on discharge planning. They met with Sue to discuss concerns such as child care, Sue’s wish to complete her education, financial stresses, Sam’s incontinence, and his sexual functioning. Richard reassured the children that their father would get better and would return home soon but that he would need to use a wheelchair.</p>
                                <p>Richard worked with Sam to navigate and mobilize community resources to help the family apply for disability benefits, subsidized child care, and other similar supports. Sue applied for and received a scholarship. Sue and Sam were relieved because this would allow her to complete her studies and re-enter the workforce to help support the family.</p>
                                <p>After discussions with Richard, Sam admitted it was unrealistic for him to return to his former job. However, he expressed an interest in helping out in elementary schools. He began to phone school-based contacts that Richard had provided to see what opportunities might be available. He decided to volunteer at an elementary school down the street from where he lived. This would give him a chance to explore future career options while completing rehabilitation from home. He was now using an electric wheelchair both at home and on sidewalks. Richard found a mechanic who reconditioned vehicles previously used by others with disabilities similar to Sam’s. The mechanic kindly offered to adapt a vehicle for Sam free of charge after his rehab treatment was complete. Sam and Sue began to feel hopeful for their family’s future and seemed to be adapting to the jolting changes in their lives fairly well.</p>
                                <p>Subsequently, Richard referred the family to a community social worker with expertise in working with persons with issues such as those Sam was facing as he began a new life back in the community.</p>

                        <p>The goals of social work in community health care include mobilizing clients&rsquo; strengths; offering a holistic perspective; identifying support networks; helping clients navigate through complex bureaucracies; providing information; and sometimes counselling. Many of the goals and interventions are similar regardless of the health-care setting. But there are some differences. How do social work skills translate when a worker interfaces with a community health-care system?</p>
                        <p>Social workers in community health care assist clients as they adjust to illness or disability, incorporating community strengths in the wellness plan they construct with a client. Practitioners in this area often follow up on previous discharge planning work if the client has just come home from the hospital. This responsibility for follow-up allows the community worker to monitor the client&rsquo;s emotional responses to their situation; explore various options in terms of medical treatment, employment, or housing; seek out essential resources; and offer ongoing support. The worker can help the client explore their own role in recovery and seek ways to build up their confidence and optimism.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps one of the most important client-centred roles for a community social worker is their work with family members. Family members may offer invaluable support or pose a risk to the client&rsquo;s recovery and well-being. In an ideal situation, however, the individuals who can offer the most help to recovering clients are members of the person&rsquo;s own family. In fact, three in ten people in Canada are family caregivers, providing care to a parent or grandparent, spouse, or child. In 2012, caregivers spent 4 to 14 hours per week providing this kind of care. Caregivers often report spending less time with their own children and their caregiving can have negative effects on family relationships and on the caregivers&rsquo; own health. They frequently report feeling depressed and in need of financial assistance. Some provide care on a full-time basis.</p>
                        <p>Social workers interface frequently with caregivers as they provide care to a family member. This social work role is very important because they see first-hand the burden felt by caregivers and are often able to provide helpful links to community supports.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, social workers are trained to recognize and intervene effectively when relational stressors, intergenerational conflict, and precursors to abuse arise. As skilled facilitators, counsellors, and system navigators, social workers strengthen community health-care programs. Collaborative multidisciplinary models that have been advanced in health-care circles, efforts to improve the social determinants of health, and work designed to empower marginalized groups are central goals in the delivery of community health care.</p>
                        <p>Kicho&rsquo;s story demonstrates how social workers can intervene with a client, the client&rsquo;s family, and community health-care resources simultaneously on the client&rsquo;s behalf. The story underscores the fact that the most powerful resource a community has to offer is often the collective lived experience and wisdom of the members of that community&mdash;especially if they are given an opportunity to support one another in a safe and caring environment.</p>

                                <p>Sally has been a social worker at a community health centre for eight years. The health centre is located in the heart of the Southeast Asian community in Vancouver. Sally runs support groups and offers individual and family counselling as well, receiving referrals from health care workers in the community. Individuals can also self-refer for access to services offered by the community heath centre.</p>
                                <p>Sally has received 15 files of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. After reviewing the list, Sally decides to offer a breast cancer support group at the CHC. She telephones each person on the list and arranges to meet with them individually to assess their suitability and their interest in joining the group. One woman does not wish to be part of a group but requests personal counselling from Sally instead, and Sally complies. Ultimately, eight women, four of southeast Asian descent, would like to participate in the group.</p>
                                <p>Among the participants is Kicho, a 37-year-old woman who has been advised by her medical team to undergo aggressive treatment for breast cancer to increase her odds of survival. Kicho has two young children and she is terrified that she will die as a result of her illness. Kicho&rsquo;s husband, parents, brother, and friends do not yet know about her diagnosis.</p>
                                <p>Sally structures the group to be held for two hours once a week for ten weeks in the early evening to allow women who are working to attend. All eight women attend the first meeting. The women enter the room tentatively and sit in a circle of comfortable chairs. Sally introduces herself, talks about the need for confidentiality and active listening, and sets forth other norms such as having only one person speak at a time. She then invites the members to introduce themselves. When it is Kicho&rsquo;s turn, she shares how alone she feels as she struggles with her diagnosis. Others in the group ask her about her family and she tells them about her children, her husband, her other family members, and her friends. As she speaks, she becomes teary and says she cries a lot now. Other members of the group then share their stories. Some are similar to Kicho&rsquo;s story and others differ. One older woman says that she, too, is alone with her fears as she has no one to share them with. She encourages Kicho to talk with her husband. Kicho nods, but says that she is not sure whether that would be a good idea. The weeks unfold as women continue to tell their stories and support each other.</p>
                                <p>During the fifth group meeting, Kicho tearfully reveals her marriage problems to the other women. Her husband had had an intimate affair that ended when Kicho found out about it two years ago. Although the affair is over, Kicho is worried that her husband will abandon her again after she has undergone breast surgery.</p>
                                <p>Sally looks around the room and notes that some other women also have tears in their eyes. She comments, &ldquo;It seems that Kicho&rsquo;s story is troubling for many of you around the circle. Does anyone have anything they wish to say?&rdquo; Silence follows as members look at the floor or wipe their eyes with tissues. After a few minutes, which seems like an eternity to Sally, Mary speaks up.</p>
                                <p>Mary explains her fear of ending the treatment process with a less-than-perfect body. She said, &ldquo;My appearance has always been so important to me. Isn&rsquo;t it important to every woman?&rdquo; Kicho replies, &ldquo;Well, yes, but living is more important to me than my appearance. But I am not sure my husband feels the same way.&rdquo; Others in the group nod and express their understanding.</p>
                                <p>Sally listens intently but does not speak, waiting for other comments. A deep discussion about women and beauty ensues. Comments follow about wanting to live, yearning to see children and grandchildren grow up, being proud of their good health and their bodies. The discussion then turns to intimate partners and their responses to their female partner&rsquo;s disease. Kicho says she is surprised that the other women seem to understand her fears. She reports that she often gets blank stares from people on the few occasions when she shares her private concerns.</p>
                                <p>The following week, the women decide they want their partners to have an opportunity to participate in a support group as well. Sally promises to speak with her supervisor to find out if there are space and resources at the centre for her to run a partners&rsquo; support group in parallel with the breast cancer support group.</p>

                    <div class="grid--full cf">
                        <p>Social work is prominent in palliative care and hospice settings in hospitals, community residences and agencies, and private homes. <span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Hospice and palliative care</span> is focused on reducing the severity of disease symptoms, rather than providing a cure, for people at the end of life. It can also include bereavement support for family members and caregivers.</p>
                        <p>The essence of palliative care is holistic, collaborative, and client-focused. The comfort of the dying individual is the first priority. Social workers assist the dying individual, family, and team members as they help each other to make the process of dying meaningful. Expertise in collaboration, facilitation, communication, system navigation, and psychosocial assessment makes the social work role crucially important in palliative care.</p>
                        <p>Generally, hospice social work includes one or more of the following services.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Pain management.</span> Often, life-threatening illness causes pain. Social workers consult with other health-care providers to determine what is causing the pain and the best ways to relieve it. Pain may be managed with narcotics and other drugs, but also by means of massage therapy and relaxation exercises, including mindfulness meditation.</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Symptom management.</span> Social workers report symptoms such as loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, difficulty breathing, bladder/bowel problems, and confusion to the medical team.</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Social, psychological, emotional, and spiritual support.</span> Social workers often focus on the well-being of the person in the final days of their lives. People in such circumstances confront a variety of psychological and spiritual issues. Different kinds of support to both the individual and the family may be helpful in these instances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Caregiver support. Social workers work closely with family and other caregivers, providing necessary support, not only during the patient&rsquo;s last stages of life, but also during the bereavement process.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work in Palliative Care Settings</p>
                        <p>Palliative care is health care for individuals who are living with a life-threatening illness, usually at an advanced stage. The goal is to provide the best quality of life for the critically or terminally ill person and ensure their comfort and dignity. Hospice palliative care focuses on holistic care by offering a wide range of health, emotional, and spiritual support services.</p>
                        <p>Palliative care is provided in a variety of places&mdash;at home, in long-term facilities, in hospitals, and in hospices. The Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, for example, has a palliative care unit that serves cancer patients. Other centres, such as the Maison Michel Sarrazin facility in Qu&eacute;bec (the first such facility opened in Canada in 1985), offer a network of services, providing both care at the facility and support in the home.</p>
                        <p>Social workers offer hands-on support and assistance in such situations. They provide instructions on how to care for the person, administer medication, and recognize signs of impending problems that might require emergency assistance. They may also help family members work through emotions regarding the illness or death of a loved one, as Sidney&rsquo;s story shows.</p>

                                <p>Sidney, a 38-year-old computer technician, is at risk of dying from non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. His wife, Josette, recently gave birth to an infant daughter, Chantal. Sidney&rsquo;s family lives in England and is seldom able to travel to Canada. Josette&rsquo;s family lives in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
                                <p>As is often the case with complicated diagnoses, Sidney&rsquo;s diagnosis takes time to complete. Meanwhile, Kevin, a social worker employed as an occasional consultant with the hospital and who has a part-time position with a community health centre, is asked to meet with Sidney to see if he can help. Kevin agrees to accept the case.</p>
                                <p>Over time, Sidney has encountered many turning points in his illness and treatment. Sometimes a treatment made him feel better and doctors gave him positive reports. At other times, he received only bad news. At first the treatment worked, and then it didn&rsquo;t. Sidney tells Kevin that he feels as though he has been on an out-of-control rollercoaster ride. Kevin and Sidney develop a rapport with each other and agree to meet regularly.</p>
                                <p>After a few months, doctors are especially concerned about the results of one particular medical test. Sidney is feeling more tired and cuts and bruises are taking longer to heal. He is losing weight. He feels worried and depressed. Sidney tells Kevin that he fears he is dying and he asks Kevin what he should do. Kevin asks him: &ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo; Sidney responds, &ldquo;I need to know what is going on with my body.&rdquo; Kevin offers to sit down to talk with Sidney and his doctor. Sidney and Kevin draw up a list of questions that Sidney needs answered, including &ldquo;Am I dying? Is there anything you can do to help me?&rdquo; They discuss the possibility of having Josette attend the meeting, too. But Sidney wants to wait until he feels stronger emotionally in order to deal with Josette&rsquo;s reaction. The meeting with the doctor is emotionally draining but helpful overall. The doctor answers all Sidney&rsquo;s questions. Sidney learns that he is indeed dying.</p>
                                <p>Sidney and Kevin spend many hours talking about Sidney&rsquo;s impending death. Finally, Sidney asks Kevin to help him break the news to his wife.They all sit together in Sidney and Josette&rsquo;s home after Chantal has gone to bed. Kevin helps support Sidney as he tells Josette that he is dying. Sidney comforts Josette and answers as many of her questions as he can. Sidney asks Kevin if he thinks the doctor would be willing to meet with the three of them together. Kevin sets up a meeting.</p>
                                <p>Meanwhile, Kevin asks Sidney and Josette what their major concerns are. Naturally, they are concerned about the progress of the illness, about the actual experience of death, and if there will be pain. Kevin teaches the couple about palliative care and the goal of ensuring comfort for the dying individual and for the family. They decide to ask the doctor what death might be like for Sidney. Sidney begins to cry and then asks two questions: &ldquo;How will my family survive without my income? And what about our wonderful little girl&mdash;how will she know who her father was?&rdquo;</p>
                                <p>Kevin is able to help ease these worries. They discuss financial issues and set up a budget. They discuss Josette&rsquo;s earning potential. Sidney has some creative ideas about ways in which Josette can juggle her career as an ultrasound technician while caring for Chantal. Finally, they talk about Sidney&rsquo;s relationship with Chantal. Sidney confides to Kevin that he deeply wishes his daughter to know about him as she grows up. Kevin helps Sidney develop some ideas aboout how to achieve this goal. Sidney is an amateur musician. He decides to compose and record a series of songs. Each song would be planned for Chantal to hear at a different stage of her life. The songs would reveal Sidney&rsquo;s love, hopes, and dreams for his daughter.</p>
                                <p>Ultimately, composing and listening to these songs together help Josette and Sidney face Sidney&rsquo;s death more calmly. The members of the palliative care team succeed in easing his pain and ensuring his physical comfort in his final days.</p>
                                <p>Not long after the songs are completed and recorded, Sidney and Josette plan his funeral. Sidney dies peacefully as soon as the planning is complete.</p>
                                <p>Kevin meets with Josette to offer her grief counselling. He helps her get through the first six weeks following Sidney&rsquo;s death and he introduces her to a bereavement support group at a local community centre for people who have lost their partners.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Marg Hancock works as a Care Coordinator for a provincial agency that delivers a range of health-care services to clients in their homes.</p>
                            <p>As a Care Coordinator, I manage a caseload of individuals who need support in order to recover from a health-related incident or to remain living as independently as possible at home.</p>
                            <p>A large part of my job is assessment and partnering with the client to devise the best possible plan to meet specific goals. We use a consistent assessment tool and conduct assessments in the individual&rsquo;s home, taking up to two hours on the initial visit. Another aspect of my work involves &ldquo;navigation&rdquo; and I get a great deal of satisfaction from helping individuals find their way through the local health network. Many of my clients are older adults. Mobility issues may have begun to detract from their ability to access community services. I have some younger clients, too. Some of my peers work exclusively with children. I work in the community now, but I also have hospital expe-rience. I work in a multidisciplinary team consisting of health professionals and a manager.</p>
                            <p>I arrived at my graduate social work studies with an interest in older adults and palliative care. I selected the &ldquo;family and individuals&rdquo; stream, picking up all the courses on working with seniors as I studied. I benefitted from a placement in a continuing care hospital setting with excellent supervision and I enrolled in community palliative care courses. Upon graduation, while working on a contract in long-term care, a social worker friend told me how much she enjoyed her work as a Care Coordinator. Her agency advertised a position involving work with older adults with a potential for work in palliative care. I applied and was hired.</p>
                            <p>My work offers significant opportunities to influence the lives of others for the better. I am often introduced to an individual or a family at a time of dynamic life changes when the gateway to intimate conversation is open. This is where the skill of listening has been my biggest ally and the source of greatest satisfaction in my work. I recall, for example, an angry, depressed senior who had alienated her family. Quiet, empathetic listening opened the door to a constructive conversation with her primary support person. I recall a 20-something man with a young family who had sustained permanent injury from a sporting accident. His grief and guilt were barriers to healing. Con-structive listening at his bedside helped him accept that ongoing counselling support should be a part of his care plan.</p>
                            <p>Conversations can become &ldquo;critical,&rdquo; and I have enhanced my skills to take part in those &ldquo;critical conversations&rdquo; constructively. I frequently find myself in situations where I face an ethical dilemma and am given resources to formulate a model of ethical decision making. There is opportunity to consult with other professionals on behalf of a client. I meet people from all walks of life and provide individualized access to the health care community. My agency&rsquo;s vision of &ldquo;outstanding care&mdash;every person, every day&rdquo; is a great fit with social work values. I value the dignity and worth of my clients and I value my own integrity and competence as well.</p>
                            <p>My job is rewarding and offers tremendous opportunities for learning. It is a secure environment from the perspective of job security, retirement pension, and so on. However, the health care field is under pressure to spend limited health care dollars wisely and Care Coordinators are not immune to those pressures. We handle large caseloads and are held accountable for all the resources we use. We are challenged to work faster and to adopt &ldquo;lean&rdquo; approaches that are not always compatible with spending time with a client.</p>
                            <p>Care Coordinators must be tolerant of bureaucracy and have skills for stick-handling creative ideas through established policy networks. While organizational and time-management skills are an asset, attention to self-care is essential, too&mdash;and what better setting for keeping your own health and well-being at the forefront than in the health care field!</p>

                        <li>In 2015, the UN Human Rights Committee criticized Canada&rsquo;s federal government for failing to meet the basic health needs of Indigenous peoples in Canada. How might social work practitioners influence the creation of policies designed to address the lowered life expectancy and higher rates of diabetes and numerous other conditions among Canada&rsquo;s Indigenous peoples?</li>
                        <li>Research one community health program in your area or province that is designed to address a health issue related to the social determinants of health. Discover the benefits that social workers in this program bring to the community. Present your findings in a brief report.</li>
                        <li>Write a brief response to the following excerpt by Jeffrey Simpson from Chronic Condition, Why Canada&rsquo;s Health Care System Needs to be Dragged into the 21st Century (2012). &ldquo;The Canadian health-care system was originally designed around hospitals and, to a fault, it remains so today&mdash;a system whose hospitals struggle to cope with changing patient demand, an aging population, higher costs, global budgets imposed by provincial capitals, fast-developing technologies, rigid rules, new drugs and the social inequities that lead to poor health.&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
