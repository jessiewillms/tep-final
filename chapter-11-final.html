By 2041, there will be over nine million older adults, comprising 25 percent of the population. Twenty-eight percent of older Canadians are immigrants, which presents special issues for social work practice with this age group. Because of the sheer size of this older adult cohort, their concerns will likely be heard loud and clear.
                    <br> In the coming years, these underlying demographic facts will increasingly affect most aspects of Canadian society, particularly in relation to health care needs and social service provision across the country.

                <p>In its recent “World Report on Ageing and Health” (2015), the World Health Organization has called for “Ageing Well” to become a universal priority. “The greatest costs to society,” the Report stresses, “are not the expenditures made to foster this functional ability, but the benefits that might be missed if we fail to make the appropriate adaptations and investments.” It argues for strategies that extend beyond health care to include the development of communities where older adults are “healthier, happier, and more productive” members of society.</p>

This planning includes the funding of pension plans and health-care systems, as well as determining the number of immigrants needed to boost the labour force.</p>
                        <p>Figure 11.1 shows the projected population growth for children and seniors in Canada, comparing data from 1991 to the present with figures projected through to 2061. The graph shows that the numbers of older adults will continue to increase relative to children in our population.</p>
                        <p>Statisticians use data to calculate the median age of a population&mdash;the number signifying the halfway point in a group&rsquo;s age range. In Canada, the median age is about 40: about half of Canadians are under 40 and about half are over 40. The median age of women is higher than men (41.1 compared to 39.4) due to the persistent higher life expectancy of women (although the gap between genders has been narrowing). Overall, the median age of Canadians has been increasing, which means that the population as a whole is growing older.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian government typically classifies people aged 65 and over as &ldquo;elderly.&rdquo; At this age, citizens are eligible for federal benefits, such as full Canada Pension Plan benefits and Old Age Security payments. The World Health Organization has no fixed standard but notes that 65 is the commonly accepted age for &ldquo;senior&rdquo; status in most core nations.</p>
                        <p>Gerontologists (scientists who study aging) often divide the older adult population into three subgroups: the young-old (approximately 65&ndash;74), the middle-old (ages 75&ndash;84), and the old-old (over age 85). People aged 90 and over are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;the frail-old.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Why Is Canada Aging So Rapidly?</p>
                        <p>According to all projection scenarios, the Canadian population will continue to grow over the next 50 years, reaching between 40.0 million people and 63.5 million people by 2063 (Statistics Canada, 2014). &ldquo;The greying of Canada&rdquo; is a term that describes how larger and larger numbers of our population are getting older and older. (See Figure 11.1.)</p>
                        <p>Three main factors account for the aging of the Canadian population:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">The baby boom.</span> Nearly one third of the Canadian population was born in the generation following World War II (between 1946 and 1966), when Canadian families averaged 3.7 children each (compared to 1.7 children per family today). This period is referred to as the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">baby boom.</span> The so-called baby boomers began to reach the age of 65 in 2011.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">A low birth rate.</span> The proportion of old to young will continue to increase because the average number of children per woman has declined. Many couples are postponing having families, or deciding not to have children at all. This trend reflects the increased participation of women in the labour force, the importance placed on women establishing their own careers, and the increasing economic demands placed on young families. A low birth rate contributes to the higher percentage of older people in the population.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Increasing life expectancy.</span> Statistics Canada data that group older Canadians by age show that we are living longer, primarily as a result of healthier lifestyles and universal health care. Between 1983 and 2013, the number of citizens over 85 increased by more than 100 percent. In 2013, the number of centenarians (those 100 years or older) in Canada was 6,900, or almost 20 per 100,000 persons, compared to only 11 centenarians per 100,000 persons in&#160;2001.</li>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Older Adults&mdash;A Diverse Group</p>
                        <p><a href="#" id="page-343" class="ch-link"></a>In Canada, as elsewhere, the population of those aged 65 and older is not a homogeneous group. For example, living arrangements vary: 56 percent live as part of a couple; 25 percent live on their own; 12&#8239;percent live with members of their extended family; and 7 percent live in a long-term care institution (Statistics Canada, 2011). Older adults living in rural areas as opposed to urban locations tend to remain in their home communities, where they support each other, despite fewer and limited services. In 2013, 67 percent of Canadians over the age of 85 were women. Seniors aged 85 and over are more likely than younger seniors to have serious medical conditions and disabilities, and therefore generally have a greater need for social support and health care.</p>
                        <p>Almost 21 percent of our current population was born outside of Canada, but 28 percent of the country&rsquo;s older adults were born elsewhere (Chappell, McDonald, and Stones, 2008). Older recent immigrants may face declining health, isolation, language barriers, discrimination, and other obstacles.</p>
                        <p>Current research estimates that up to seven percent of the senior population is openly LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer). That number is expected to double by 2030 (Sheldon, 2014; Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2011).</p>
                        <p>Becoming a senior does not automatically mean needing the services of a social worker, however. People age differently. Some remain physically and mentally fit; others face problems such as social exclusion, health crises, loss of mobility, inadequate income and housing, prejudice, crime victimization, and abuse. It is generally in these more difficult situations that the social worker and other social service professionals get involved.</p>

                        <p>Common phrases such as &ldquo;over the hill&rdquo; reveal North American society&rsquo;s frequently negative attitudes toward old age and older people in general. <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">Ageism</span> can be defined as any attitude, action, policy, or institutional structure that subordinates or oppresses a person or group on the basis of age. Some argue that ageism is different from other &ldquo;isms,&rdquo; such as racism or sexism, because at some point everyone will grow old (unless, of course, a person dies young) and will therefore likely experience ageism. But the prevalence of negative attitudes toward an entire cohort of citizens serves to emphasize and condone ageist attitudes even further. Additionally, older persons may be part of more than one marginalized group. For example, an older individual may be female and living in poverty in addition to being old. In this situation, the individual may be subject to three societal &ldquo;isms&rdquo; simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>Every culture has a certain set of expectations and assumptions about aging. Lena Dominelli, a professor of Social and Community Development at Southampton University in England, believes that the decline in the economic status of older people in the West is part of the explanation for ageism (Dominelli, 2004: 135). In Dominelli&rsquo;s view, seniors in Western culture are often presented as a homogeneous group that is a burden to society. According to Dominelli, Western countries tend to regard people in materialist terms&mdash;people&rsquo;s worth or value to society is often based on how much they make, the size of their house, or the kind of car they drive. In retirement, the income of seniors usually drops. Furthermore, with urbanization, and especially with the breakdown of the extended family, the elderly have tended to lose their status in the family and in society as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Older persons have been inaccurately blamed for the high cost of health care. Also, they are sometimes portrayed in the press as &ldquo;bed blockers&rdquo; in health-care settings, particularly in hospitals. (&ldquo;Bed blocking&rdquo; is a term used to describe the long-term occupation of hospital beds, chiefly by elderly people, due to a shortage of suitable care elsewhere.) Older individuals identified as &ldquo;bed blockers&rdquo; can be abruptly discharged from hospital without adequate preparation. Government policies may unintentionally reinforce bias by using ambiguous language when establishing practices intended to enhance safety. In some provinces, hospital patients who do not require acute care are labelled as needing an &ldquo;alternative level of care.&rdquo; This label could be leveraged by care providers to move the identified person out of the bed as soon as possible, but it also may put individuals at risk if they are discharged from hospital too soon.</p>
                        <p>North Americans generally seem to fear aging more (and be more ageist) than others. This is perhaps best exemplified by the high sales of beauty products and the common use of plastic surgery to restore a youthful look. Many media portrayals reflect dismissive and disrespectful cultural attitudes toward older adults. However, not all societies and cultures view older people this way. Many Aboriginal, Asian, and African societies (and many cultures within Western societies) place a high value on the wisdom and life experiences of the elderly. In many societies, older adults are traditionally viewed as sources of guidance and knowledge. Perhaps, as our population as a whole continues to age, some of our negative attitudes and perceptions will gradually begin to change.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-347" class="ch-link"></a>Physical inactivity may not appear to be a social work issue, but many emotional, spiritual, and mental health issues&mdash;perhaps especially among seniors&mdash;are directly related to it. Inactivity can lead to preventable health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, and osteoarthritis (along with the chronic pain associated with it). According to the Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute, physical inactivity can also lead to depression, lack of energy, chronic disease, weight problems, disability, and premature death. The Canadian government estimates that billions of dollars per year could be saved if physical activity rates increased. For many seniors, walking, gardening, or taking part in low-impact sports could lead to a better physical and emotional state. Unfortunately, the majority of seniors are inactive: &ldquo;More than 40 percent [of baby boomers] said they are not moderately active for 30 to 60 minutes at least three times a week.&rdquo; Given reduced strength and impaired physical fitness, Canadian seniors also face significant risks due to common accidents such as falling. Hospital admissions for unintentional injuries occur most often among older adults (Heart and Stroke Foundation, 2013).</p>

                        <p>Canada&rsquo;s pension system is held in high regard throughout the world for the way it combines basic income security with public and private pension plans. The Canadian pension system has three tiers:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.</span> These plans provide income security for seniors independent of their prior participation in the workforce.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Canada Pension Plan (Qu&eacute;bec Pension Plan in Qu&eacute;bec).</span> The CPP provides pension benefits to individuals upon retirement or if they become disabled. It also provides benefits to the dependants of contributors who are disabled or deceased. The amount of the benefit depends on the level of contributions during the contributory period.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Private pension plans.</span> These consist of workplace plans and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), both of which result in tax breaks upon contribution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Until recently, this three-tiered system has served seniors well. Canadian seniors&rsquo; financial status improved significantly over the last 30 years. However, a 2013 report from the Bank of Montreal states that the average baby boomer falls about $400,000 short of adequate savings to maintain their lifestyle in retirement. The average senior couple spends approximately $54,000 a year, requiring accumulated savings of $1,352,000 in order to sustain themselves (not taking into account CPP and Old Age Pension payments). Individual Canadian boomers estimated they needed savings of $658,000 to feel financially secure in retirement but only saved an average of $228,000. Seventy-one percent of boomers said they plan to work part time in retirement. This will have a ripple effect on the economy as boomers continue to work but spend less (BMO Financial Group, 2013).</p>

                        <p>Often isolated in their homes, seniors are the leading targets of fraudulent crimes, such as fake investment opportunities, phony contests, and false fundraising campaigns. Criminals are using more and more sophisticated techniques, often misrepresenting themselves as employees of a bank or other financial institution. In some cases, seniors have lost their life savings.</p>

In a long-term care setting, LGBTQ+ clients tend to conceal or &ldquo;selectively disclose&rdquo; their sexual orientation in order to feel safe.</p>
                        <p>A study titled The Aging and Health Report: Disparities and Resilience among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Older Adults found that older LGBTQ+ adults have higher rates of disability and depression than their heterosexual peers.

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-349" class="ch-link"></a>After much legal and public debate, Canada now has its first doctor-assisted dying legislation. The law received royal assent on June 17, 2016 and sets out guidelines with respect to medical assistance in dying. But the details of the new legislation are not without controversy.</p>
                        <p>In June 2014, the Qu&eacute;bec National Assembly had passed &ldquo;An Act Respecting End-of-Life Care&rdquo; (Bill 52). This legislation specified rights with respect to end-of-life care and regulates &ldquo;continuous palliative sedation&rdquo; and &ldquo;medical aid in dying.&rdquo; In February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada followed suit and ruled unanimously that Canadian adults in grievous, unending pain have a right to end their life with a doctor&rsquo;s help. The ruling established that the &ldquo;sanctity of life&rdquo; also includes &ldquo;the passage into death.&rdquo; The court then suspended its ruling for 12 months to allow time for the Canadian Parliament to draft new laws.</p>
                        <p>In April 2016, the government introduced a more restrictive bill that requires a person seeking a doctor-assisted death to be a consenting adult, at least 18 years of age, in &ldquo;an advanced stage of irreversible decline&rdquo; from a serious and incurable disease, illness, or disability, and for whom a natural death is &ldquo;reasonably foreseeable.&rdquo; It did not extend the right to assisted dying to those suffering from mental illnesses or to mature minors. Nor did it allow advance directives ( &ldquo;living wills&rdquo;). This bill formed the basis of the new legislation that received royal assent on June 17.</p>
                    
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Conflicting Viewpoints on Contentious Issues</p>

                        <p>In defence of the new legislation, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada and Minister of Health issued a joint statement that reiterated that the new law &ldquo;strikes the right balance between personal autonomy for those seeking access to medically assisted dying and protecting the vulnerable.&rdquo; They emphasized that Health Canada will continue to work with the provinces and territories as provisions of the legislation come into force, and further study will be done with respect to medical assistance in dying in the context of mature minors, people for whom mental illness is the sole underlying condition and advance requests.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Some experts maintain that the end-of-life provision is unconstitutional because it narrows the eligibility criteria as established by the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that struck down the ban on assisted death.</p>
                        <p>The right-to-die movement has gained strength as a result of the &ldquo;greying&rdquo; of the population. New legislation seems to be driven less by the desires of older adults, however, than by the anxieties of a younger generation, whose members seek comfort in knowing that they can control the end of their lives.</p>
                        <p>In 2015, the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) produced a draft outline for a &ldquo;principles-based approach&rdquo; to physician-assisted death. The principles include the importance of patient consent and capacity, and respect for patient autonomy, as well as respect for a physician&rsquo;s personal ethical values. (The CMA conducted an internal survey in 2015 and found that 63&#8239;percent of its members would not give medical aid in dying to a patient who requested it.)</p>
                        <p>Gerontological social workers will find themselves handling complicated cases in which an individual&rsquo;s right to a dignified death must be balanced with a need to protect vulnerable members of the population, especially clients who have dementia. Most legal and medical experts agree that advance directives can serve as useful tools as long as they are frequently reviewed and updated, with current input from loved ones and primary health-care providers.</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">“People tell me they worry more about money than they worry about cancer”</p>

                                            <p>Every Thursday, Randy Filinski drives a group of seniors to one of two government-sponsored physiotherapy sessions in Toronto’s Scarborough area and sees firsthand the realities of inadequate health-care coverage in the retirement years.</p>

                                            <p>“When you watch the patients who go with benefits from work—they pay the $60 or $70—they actually get better, because they’re actually getting the one-on-one care, versus the people I drive who are just dazed and confused after their 15-minute OHIP session.”</p>

                                            <p>The research confirms it. “A few years ago, we asked Canadians what they considered the biggest risk when planning for their retirement,” says Chris Buttigieg, a senior manager at the Bank of Montreal in Toronto. “And the overwhelming response was that they were unprepared for unexpected costs.”</p>

                                            <p>Also, many Canadians are confused about what will be covered in retirement. Forty-four percent of Canadians expect to pay nothing for drugs, the 2014 Sun Life Canadian Health Index found.</p>

                                            <p>But pay they will. Without private coverage, Canadians can expect to spend an average of $5,391 a year on out-of-pocket medical costs after age 65, according to a 2014 BMO Wealth Institute report. And these numbers will rise.</p>

                                            <p>“Between 2004 and 2014, health-care costs rose by 54&#160;percent, compared with shelter (41 percent), clothing (33&#160;percent) and food (16 percent). Health-care costs are rising—from an inflation perspective—significantly faster,” says Mr. Buttigieg. He says disability poses a large threat: “Between ages 65 and 74, 26.3 percent [of people] will become disabled.”</p>

                                            <p>If the disability is mild, there may be a need for modifications to a home, an electric wheelchair ($2,050 and up), a scooter ($1,000–$5,000), and/or a walker ($150 and up). But if a person is severely disabled, he or she may require a personal care worker—at a cost of $16 to $30 an hour—or a registered nurse ($24 to $76 an hour).</p>

                                            <p>But the biggest sticker shock will be for long-term care. “Three quarters of Canadians have no long-term financial plan for long-term care if they need it,” says Stephen Frank, vice-president of policy development and health at Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association.</p>

                                            <p>According to Statistics Canada, there is about a 10-percent chance of needing long-term care by age 55, a 30-percent chance by 65, and about a 50-percent chance by 75. As long-term care isn’t covered under the<span> Canada Health Act</span>, depending on an individual’s province of residence and annual income, home care may be either covered, partly covered, or—most likely—not covered at all.</p>

                                            <p>The bills can be steep, leading seniors to cash in retirement savings or rely on children or other family members for financial support. A nursing home in Ontario, for example, ranges between $14,000 and $132,000 annually, with long-term care averaging $20,800 to $29,300, according to Senioropolis, a virtual community for Canadian seniors.</p>

                                            <p>In addition to long-term care, there are prescription-drug costs to consider, a reality that concerns 53 percent of Canadians, according to Sun Life. While provincial plans cover most prescription drugs for residents 65 or older, those who retire earlier are paying out-of-pocket for these medications.</p>

                                            <p>And if an individual requires a drug that’s not covered under the provincial drug formulary or under a catastrophic drug program—such as costly oral cancer medications, a specialty drug for a condition like rheumatoid arthritis, or a biologic drug in Ontario and the Atlantic provinces—he or she could be on the hook for thousands of dollars a year.</p>

                                            <p>That’s because Ontarians and residents of Atlantic provinces, unlike those in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, do not have their cancer treatments fully covered. That can be pricey. For example, the average cost of an oral cancer drug is $6,000 a month.</p>

                                            <p>Pamela Bowes, manager of the Money Matters and workplace programs at Wellspring in Toronto, regularly meets people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer and are waking up to the financial realities of treating the disease.</p>

                                            <p>“I have had people tell me they worry more about money than they worry about cancer.”</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">Caring for an older family member is often a long-term job that can become more difficult and complex over time. Exhaustion can put a great strain on family members who have the responsibility of caring for aging relatives, and can trigger frustration and resentment. For this reason, “self-care” is essential—before burnout occurs.</p>
                            <p class="text--caption">Moreover, women dedicate almost twice as much time to these types of tasks. Even working outside the home does not appear to reduce the amount of time women spend providing care—26.4 hours a month, versus 14.5 hours for men (Stobert and Cranswick, 2003).</p>

                        <p><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Elder abuse</span><a href="#" id="page-352" class="ch-link"> is any action by </a>someone in a position of trust or power that results in harm or distress to an older person. &ldquo;Abuse can happen when the aggressor wants to intimidate, isolate, dominate, or control another person&rdquo; (Government of Canada, 2015). Abuse may take place in the home or in an institutional care setting. It can be a single event or a pattern of behaviour. Like other forms of family violence, elder abuse in the home is largely hidden from view. Isolated and often frail, older adults are highly vulnerable to mistreatment, sometimes by those closest to and/or responsible for caring for them.</p>
                        <p>In Canada in 2013, more than 2,900 seniors (56.8 per 100,000) were the victims of family violence. The perpetrator in 43 percent of cases was an adult child of the victim; in 28 percent of cases, it was the victim&rsquo;s spouse. The rate of family violence toward senior females was 26 percent higher than toward senior males (62.7&#8239;versus 49.7 per 100,000) (Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics , 2013).</p>
                        <p>Researchers have found that people over 85 years of age are most likely to suffer from dementia or other chronic illnesses and that this can render an individual physically or mentally incapable of reporting violence to the police (Welfel et al., 2000).</p>
                        <p>Besides physical violence, abuse can take other forms: emotional or psychological, sexual, and the most commonly reported form, financial (perpetrators of the latter form can be either close to the older adult or a complete stranger). Neglect is frequently associated with abuse.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Understanding and Preventing Elder Abuse in Families</p>
                        <p>The first step in preventing elder abuse within families is to understand the causes. Mia Dauvergne (2003) discusses several possible reasons: the stressfulness of the situation, especially if the family member has to balance a job, children, and other responsibilities in addition to caregiving; the fact that violence may be a learned behaviour for the caregiver and is now his or her way of responding to a stressful situation; the fact that the lives of the senior and the family caregiver are so intricately intertwined; and the possible effects of discriminatory attitudes toward the aging family member. Furthermore, &ldquo;in some situations, the abuse may result from addiction issues (drugs, alcohol, or gambling) or mental health problems&ldquo; (Statistics&#8239;Canada,&#160;2015).</p>
                        <p>The extent of informal caregiving is often understated. Most caregivers are looking after their own parents and their spouse&rsquo;s parents, and many are providing help to close friends and neighbours. &ldquo;While the majority of caregivers (57 percent) reported providing care to one person during the past 12 months, assisting more than one care receiver was not uncommon. In particular, 27 percent of caregivers reported caring for two and 15 percent for three or more family members or friends with a long-term illness, disability or aging needs&rdquo; (Sinha, 2013).</p>
                        <p>It is neither accurate nor fair, however, to ascribe most of the cause of elder abuse to caregivers. In households where abuse of an older person does occur, family relationships can sometimes be so complicated that the older person may have played a role in the development of an unhealthy dynamic, such as co-dependency. For example, the older person may have provided many years of care, housing, and food to an adult child who is coping with unemployment, mental health issues, and/or a substance use disorder. When the parent grows old, the caregiving can become especially difficult as both parties can become angry, frustrated, and abusive toward each other due to years of built-up tensions.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">The mistreatment or neglect of an older adult by a family member, a friend, a health-care provider in an institutional setting, or someone who provides assistance with basic needs or services. Elder abuse can be physical, emotional, sexual, medical, or (most often) financial. Any action that exploits an older person for personal or financial gain is a form of abuse.</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Relieving Caregiver Stress Can Reduce Elder Abuse</p>
                        <p><a href="#" id="page-353" class="ch-link"></a>It is troubling to note that fewer than one in five care providers reported that they received help if they needed a break. Yet when asked to identify the most useful thing to allow them to continue providing help, the most common answer (51 percent of those aged 45 to 64) was &ldquo;occasional relief or sharing of responsibilities.&rdquo; Flexible work arrangements and financial compensation were also on the list.</p>
                        <p>There is the additional complication of seniors looking after seniors. Stobert and Cranswick report that over one in twelve seniors is also looking after at least one other senior: a spouse (25 percent), a close friend (33 percent), or a neighbour (19 percent). The gap between men and women with respect to giving care in this age group is higher than for younger caregivers. Moreover, only 18 percent of the senior caregivers indicated that someone else could take over should they need, or want, time off&mdash;pointing to an even greater need for support.</p>
                        <p>The physical and psychological effects of abuse against seniors are traumatic&mdash;if not completely devastating&mdash;for the senior, for the family, and perhaps even for the abuser. In the face of all these concerns and the growing older adult population, it is essential that governments at all levels, employers, other family members, friends, and social workers find more ways to provide relief and support to those who are giving care to seniors.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-354" class="ch-link"></a>Another issue of concern to social workers is abuse in facilities providing care to older people, including acute-care hospitals, nursing homes, and retirement homes. In this context, institutional abuse is any act or omission directed at a resident that causes the person harm, or that wrongfully deprives that person of her or his independence.</p>
                        <p>This definition focuses more on the consequences of acts on residents and less on the intent. The abuse could be of an individual nature, whereby a staff member at an institution directly abuses a resident. But often the abuse is systemic, whereby situations are allowed to develop that facilitate or permit abuse and neglect. It could also involve the failure to provide adequate safeguards for residents and staff. Guarding against such forms of abuse and neglect, both intentional and unintentional, is important not only for family members and relatives, but also for social workers associated with these older adults and the institutions in which they find themselves.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Combatting Systemic Abuse</p>
                        <p>Systemic abuse in institutional settings often results from policies, procedures, and processes that appear to be designed to maximize care and/or safety. For example, a facility may have a policy that permits staff members to search residents&rsquo; rooms at any time for alcohol or medication. The intent of the policy may be to protect cognitively impaired residents from harm, but the outcome is an invasion of privacy.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, institutions typically have numerous policies regarding eating, wake-up, and sleep times. Often, these routines conflict with residents&rsquo; lifelong eating and sleeping patterns. Residents also might find it difficult to question these policies as they are framed in terms of protection. One important way that social workers can assist with preventing abuse of seniors is by using various advocacy strategies, resident councils, and family councils. Ongoing staff training and policy reviews are also important.</p>
                        <p>The &ldquo;home&rdquo; or &ldquo;residence&rdquo; model for long-term care can help overcome some of the problems of abuse in institutional settings. Some facilities have found that developing a charter of rights works well in addressing abuse.</p>
                        <p>Awareness of the widespread abuse of older adults is growing, and social service agencies are responding with community-based initiatives that are proving effective in reducing the incidence of abuse and eliminating some of the causes.</p>
                        <p>As of 2011, the Government of Alberta, municipalities, and local non-profit and voluntary sector organizations are collaborating to offer a variety of services and supports to stop abuse from occurring and to restore older adults&rsquo; safety if they have experienced abuse. These services and supports may include counselling, dispute resolution, legal aid, crisis response, shelter services, and safe and affordable housing.</p>
                        <p>Community members are encouraged to &ldquo;see it,&rdquo; &ldquo;name it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;check it&rdquo; as outlined in the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Right!&rdquo; Neighbours, Friends and Families campaign developed under Canada&rsquo;s Federal Elder Abuse Initiative. &ldquo;Seeing it&rdquo; means noticing if something seems amiss, but also not jumping to conclusions. &ldquo;Naming it&rdquo; means letting the older adult know what you are observing. &ldquo;Checking it&rdquo; means asking the older adult if they are alright and offering to assist.</p>

                                        <p>As older Canadians become more physically frail, they are often less able to defend themselves against bullying and abuse. They may not see or hear as well, or think as clearly as they used to, leaving openings for unscrupulous people to take advantage of them.</p>

                                        <p>Older adults can be abused in their own homes, in relatives’ homes, and even in facilities responsible for their care. If you suspect that an elderly person is at risk from a neglectful or overwhelmed caregiver, or is being preyed upon financially, it is important to speak up. Learn about the warning signs of elder abuse, what the risk factors are, and how you can prevent and report the problem.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-356" class="ch-link"></a>In the past three decades, there has been a devolution from institution-based services to community- or home-based services, given that more and more seniors are healthy and living on their own. Most older Canadians express a preference for remaining in their own homes, and it is estimated that between 85 and 90 percent of care for older Canadians is provided in the home by relatives. As Canadians age, informal caregiving is becoming increasingly important to the well-being of seniors. According to the 2008/2009 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)&ndash;Healthy Aging, an estimated 3.8 million Canadians who were aged 45 or older (35 percent) were providing informal care to a senior with a short- or long-term health condition. In 2012, more than 5 million Canadians cared for an older family member, most of whom were living in their own homes (Statistics Canada, 2015). Informal caregivers&mdash;family and friends who provide unpaid assistance with tasks such as transportation and personal care&mdash;help seniors remain in their homes, thereby reducing demands on the health-care system.</p>
                        <p>Caring for someone with a health condition or limitation, particularly a cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or dementia, can cause physical and emotional problems and create financial and social burdens for the caregiver. This may be especially true for caregivers who are seniors themselves. On the other hand, providing care can give individuals pleasure and pride, enhance their self-worth, and help them to build closer relationships with the care recipient.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-357" class="ch-link"></a>Home care falls within provincial jurisdiction. In Canada, there are at least 663 agencies providing home care services, with 93 percent of delivery agencies receiving some government funding and just over 50 percent receiving all of their funding from government sources. Under the Canada Health Act, home care is an extended health service, which is not insured and to which the principles of the act do not apply. The home care workforce is largely unregulated and largely composed of women. Many work part time and must hold multiple jobs to make an adequate income. They receive few fringe benefits and face limited career options.</p>
                        <p>The type of services, the amount of service, and the criteria for accessing services vary from province to province. The responsibility for home care has been delegated to a regional or local health authority in 10 of the 13 provinces and territories. Six provinces require an income test to obtain public funding for home care. Veterans Affairs Canada provides home care services to clients with wartime or special-duty area service when the service is not available to them through provincial and territorial programs. Home care services are also offered jointly by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada and Health Canada, which together have responsibility for on-reserve First Nations home care.</p>
                        <p>The slow pace and piecemeal development of home care services have left many older Canadians without programs that properly meet their physical, emotional, and social needs. Many social workers are convinced that nothing short of a universal and comprehensive national home care system is necessary. As hospital care is cut and people are sent home to recover, resources go to those with the most acute medical needs. This leaves frail older persons and those with disabilities at a disadvantage (Armstrong, Armstrong, and Neysmith, 2015).</p>

                                <p>The tide of dementia is swelling, and no country will be spared. There are no effective drugs, no cure—and in Canada, no national strategy for a major public health issue that will only keep growing. This is not just a problem for old people. It is everyone’s problem.</p>

                                <p>“I can think of no other disease that has such a profound effect on loss of function, loss of independence, and the need for care,” Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, said in March 2015. “I can think of no other disease so deeply dreaded by anyone who wants to age gracefully and with dignity. I can think of no other disease that places such a heavy burden on families, communities, and societies. I can think of no other disease where innovation, including breakthrough discoveries to develop a cure, is so badly needed.”</p>

                                <p>Dementia rates are rising because of how rapidly Canada’s population is aging, and we will all feel the economic and social burdens of the disease.</p>

                                <p>There is no question: if dementia doesn’t already affect you, it will some day. You could become a patient or a caregiver, or a taxpayer increasingly burdened by dementia’s spiralling costs. It is a growing public health crisis that will overwhelm countries like Canada if we are not prepared.</p>

                                <p>One in five Canadians aged 45 and older provides some form of care to seniors living with long-term health problems. If you are in your 30s, by the time you are ten years from retirement, your age cohort is even more likely to be part of this “sandwich” generation: balancing full-time work, child care, and caring for aging parents.</p>

                                <p>And it’s not just happening in rich countries: poorer nations are experiencing a faster rise in dementia rates, too.</p>

                                <p>But there is still time. Dementia is finally becoming a global health priority: the world’s first G8 dementia summit was held in 2013. Canada does not have a national dementia strategy, but it has committed to developing one and is investing millions of dollars in a major research network dedicated to neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia.</p>

                                <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Alzheimer’s Disease</p>

                                <p>Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, slowly destroys nerve cells in the brain. It affects primarily those over the age of 65, but it is considered to be an illness and not a normal part of aging. There are no drugs that cure Alzheimer’s, but there are medications that can help relieve some of the symptoms.</p>

                                <ul class="ul--list">
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item">1,120: The number of Alzheimer’s drugs investigated between 1995 and 2014. Only four have made it to market, and all treat symptoms, not the disease itself.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Lifestyle Choices Affect Our Risk</p>

                                <p>The good news is that we can do something about dementia. Researchers have discovered that lifestyle choices affect our&#160;risk: one in three cases of Alzheimer’s disease are attributable to risk factors that can be altered, such as smoking and physical&#160;inactivity.</p>

                                <p>Researchers believe that abnormal changes in the brain may begin up to 25 years before memory-related Alzheimer’s symptoms start to appear. That means health choices you make in middle age can have a huge impact. For example, for each unit increase of body mass index (BMI) in a 50-year-old person, one study predicts the onset of dementia symptoms 6.7 months earlier. In another study, participants who engaged in physical activities at least twice a week in mid-life had half the dementia risk of sedentary people.</p>

                                <p>There is preliminary—and controversial—European research that suggests controlling risk factors has begun to affect how many people are getting dementia.</p>

                                <ul class="ul--list">
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item">22 percent: The reduction in how many people 65 and older were living with dementia in 2011 than predicted in 1990 (according to one U.K. study), meaning that overall numbers are estimated to be stabilizing rather than rising.</li>

                                </ul>

                                <p>The onset of dementia can cause emotional and financial stress for caregiving family members. They may become dependent upon physicians, other family members, friends, and a variety of health and social services. At the same time, caregivers may have mixed feelings about entrusting the care of a helpless relative to strangers over whom they have little control. Dealing with these situations and emotions is often the job of the social worker.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-362" class="ch-link"></a>In 2012, more than 5 million people in Canada provided care related to poor health, disability, or other aging-related problem for someone over the age of 64. These people provided care either in the recipient&rsquo;s home, in their own home, or in a care facility (Statistics Canada, 2015).</p>
                        <p>Most of the caregivers and care receivers were women. Some caregivers gave up their jobs to provide personal care for an ill parent or spouse, resulting in major financial, emotional, and health-related implications for the caregiver.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, the extent of informal caregiving is often understated. It is estimated that between 85 and 90 percent of care for older Canadians is provided in the home by relatives. As Canadians age, informal caregiving is becoming increasingly important to the well-being of seniors.</p>
                        <p> Most older Canadians express a strong preference for remaining in their own homes. Informal caregivers&mdash;family and friends who provide unpaid assistance with tasks such as transportation, meal preparation, and personal care&mdash;help them to do so, while also reducing demands on the health-care system.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">More Public Financial Support Is Needed</p>
                        <p>Caring for someone with a health condition or limitation, especially cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia, can cause physical and emotional problems and create financial and social pressures for the caregiver. This may be especially true for care-givers who are seniors themselves.</p>
                        <p>Most working-age caregivers experience conflicting demands between paid work and caregiving and have to miss days at work or reduce their paid work hours. Clearly, caregivers bear a disproportionate share of the costs of caring for those with long-term health problems and disabilities. The issue of overburdened caregivers is prompting social workers, formal care providers, advocates for older adults, and family caregivers to call for more support&mdash;financial, educational, and practical&mdash;to give family caregivers a much-needed break.</p>
                        <p>Caring for older people at home puts an enormous strain on family members, yet studies have shown that caregivers believe the care they provide is better than the care that is available in institutions such as nursing homes. A strong case can be made that home care provision needs more public financial support if it is to reach all citizens and not just those who can pay for it.</p>
                        <p>Thomas and Eldrid&rsquo;s story describes how a social worker can collaborate with family members to develop a plan to help relieve some of the physical and emotional demands inherent in caregiving. In this case, the social worker acts as a sounding board and an empathetic listener.</p>
                        <p>Equally if not more importantly, the social worker can often function as a &ldquo;broker&rdquo; of additional home-care services that might be available to and affordable by the family members who are serving as caregivers. These additional services can make all the difference in alleviating the stresses experienced by the caregivers of older adults.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-363" class="ch-link"></a>Social workers can offer a fresh problem-solving perspective when informal caregivers feel exhausted and overwhelmed.</p>
                            <p>Thomas, aged 80, and Eldrid, aged 76, have been married for 58 years. Several years ago, Thomas suffered a stroke. Eldrid takes care of Thomas at home, with the help of two of her four children and occasional assistance from a home-care agency.</p>
                            <p>Partially paralyzed, Thomas becomes angry and verbally abusive when his immobility and incontinence frustrate him. Caring for Thomas is taking a toll on Eldrid&rsquo;s physical and psychological well-being. However, she would feel extremely guilty if Thomas were moved to a nursing home.</p>
                            <p>Veline, the older daughter, is worried about Eldrid&rsquo;s declining physical and mental health. Eldrid has arthritis and poor hearing. Veline would like to spend more time helping her parents, but her job as a manager of a restaurant chain keeps her extremely busy. When Veline does try to help her parents with household chores or transportation to medical appointments, she finds herself becoming angry and impatient with her father, who was often verbally abusive to her when she was growing up. The two sons, Paul and John, are younger than Veline and older than the younger daughter, Anne. Both sons live a long distance from their parents. Paul visits for two days every three months and tries to offer practical support during each stay.</p>
                            <p>Veline has contacted Shelley, a social worker in a family service agency, to talk about ways to get help for her parents. Shelley will need to conduct a psychosocial assessment and propose a plan that can support the family through this difficult period. Empathetic listening, compassion, and impartiality on Shelley&rsquo;s part will be essential in fulfilling her role.</p>
                            <p>Shelley sets up a meeting in the family home to pose assessment questions to Eldrid and Thomas. During the meeting, she notices Eldrid wince in pain as she bends to help her husband. In private, Eldrid admits to feeling downtrodden and discouraged. Upon completing the initial assessment and after speaking with each adult child (either in person or over the phone) to hear their uncensored thoughts, Shelley is getting a clearer picture of the family and the issues they are facing together.</p>
                            <p>Despite everyone&rsquo;s concerns about Eldrid, Shelley points out that Eldrid has the right to make decisions for herself and deserves respect and recognition for choosing to look after her ailing husband. Thomas, too, has a say in the type and quality of care he receives and he has voiced a strong preference to be cared for by his wife rather than by a stranger. But Eldrid has confided to Shelley that she &ldquo;never has any time for herself&rdquo; and that she is feeling &ldquo;burnt out.&rdquo; With Shelley present, Eldrid has agreed to discuss her needs with each adult child individually. Shelley will also speak with Thomas separately.</p>
                            <p>As a first step, Eldrid and Shelley discuss an ideal plan that might include ways that each child can help relieve some of the pressure on Eldrid, regardless of where they live. Perhaps Anne can come to the house one morning, afternoon, or evening per week. Perhaps John, a successful entrepreneur, can pay for additional homemaking help, such as a cleaning service. Paul might extend his visits to five days so that Eldrid can enjoy restorative visits with her sister, who lives two hours away. When Shelley presents this plan to Thomas, he frowns but then replies curtly, &ldquo;Whatever Eldrid wants is fine with me.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Eldrid and Shelley acknowledge the fact that the ideal plan might not work out. In that case, could the family afford more paid in-home help? Could they arrange regular respite care to relieve Eldrid&rsquo;s workload? Would they consider a move for Thomas to a long-term care setting? The family agrees to discuss further options if the need arises. Shelley knows that if that happens, the conversations will become more difficult. Her communication skills and family negotiation skills would be put to the test if a major shift of responsibility were required.</p>
                            <p>Shelley sets up appointments and arranges Skype sessions for the family members to discuss their roles in the ideal plan, first with each person individually and then with the entire family. Shelley prepares a list of community services (home nursing care, paid homemakers, Meals on Wheels, friendly visitors, and respite care) that could help the family cope as needed. She is relieved that the whole family, including Thomas, have agreed to implement a plan that could maintain stability in the home while giving Eldrid some much-needed time for herself.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-364" class="ch-link"></a>At the time of the 2011 census, 7.1 percent of Canadians over 65 lived in special care homes, usually nursing homes. Among those Canadians over 85, however, the percentage was 29.6. Projections for 2031 are that the number of long-term care beds will triple or even quadruple. </p>
                        <p>More often than not, responsibility for looking after residents of long-term care facilities falls on other family members, many of whom themselves are in need of care. Family caregivers to seniors in long-term care homes help their loved one with personal care, medical treatments, banking, paying bills, and managing finances on a weekly basis. Over the past few years, the number of people in need of transfer to long-term care homes has increased. More long-term services and programming are now essential but not always available. Social workers play an important role in the provision of long-term care for older adults (Statistics&nbsp;Canada, 2011).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Components and Phases of Long-Term Care</p>
                        <p>Social work in this field is multidisciplinary, allowing social workers to practise collaboratively and to join other health professionals in advocating for their clients. The components of long-term care are health care and social services to provide assessment, treatment, rehabilitation, and supportive care, as well as to prevent the increased disability of individuals of all age groups who have chronic physical, developmental, or emotional impairments. Social workers in long-term care settings are involved during all the phases of care, from pre-admission through residency to the termination of residency at the time of discharge, transfer, or death.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Pre-admission phase.</span> As the first contact with the resident and family, the social worker deals with client and family feelings about placement and provides information about the facility and services. This is an important phase, as the social worker can help the family deal with issues of immediate concern and identify potential future issues as well.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Admission phase.</span> Social workers are usually responsible for the admission process. During admission, the social worker helps the resident and family become familiar with the facility and its routines. The social worker is often the first liaison between the resident and family and any other community agency that was previously involved. Often, social workers engage in counselling during this phase as the resident and family members adjust to a new reality.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Residency phase.</span> A variety of interventions may occur during residency that involve the social worker. Social workers regularly work at the individual, family, community, and policy levels. Work at the individual level focuses on the social and emotional impacts of physical and mental illness or impairment and the prevention of further physical and mental health problems. Social workers work with families in discussing palliative care and end-of-life issues, dealing with family members who are feeling guilt related to the placement, or providing information about care and prevention issues. Commonly, social workers are involved in locating and arranging resources and in developing or implementing innovative programs and policy.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Discharge, transfer, or death phase.</span> Discharge and transfer planning is a key aspect of social work in long-term care. In the case of the death of the resident, social workers may provide grief counselling for team members and the family.</li>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-365" class="ch-link"></a>In this story, a social worker helps an older client cope with a major life transition. The story provides insight into generalist practice with older adults. </p>
                            <p>For three months, 85-year-old Claire has been convalescing in the long-term care unit of a medical centre. She had suffered a fall while entering her daughter Daphne&rsquo;s home, where she had been living since moving from her own home two years before when managing a household became too challenging for her. Claire has been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had been using a walker, but walking is now very painful. A long-term care social worker has been asked to help the medical team assess the viability of Claire returning to her daughter&rsquo;s home.</p>
                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Facilitating Client Choices</p>
                            <p>It is clear that Claire is facing a major life transition&mdash;from being a relatively independent person who could look after herself to someone who is dependent on others and whose mobility is compromised. The team of workers assigned to Claire&rsquo;s case recognize that Claire is confronting several life stressors: declining health, the threat of losing her independence, and financial worries about the costs of residing in a long-term care facility.</p>
                            <p>Despite her setbacks, Claire is adamant that she wishes to return to her daughter&rsquo;s home once she is well enough to be discharged. The team respects Claire&rsquo;s determination and &ldquo;fighting spirit,&rdquo; but they must investigate whether returning to live in this environment is a realistic goal for Claire. </p>
                            <p>To determine the feasibility of discharging Claire to Daphne&rsquo;s home, various team members carry out separate assessments. An occupational therapist conducts an evaluation with Claire to observe whether she has the necessary strength and stamina to prepare her own meals. (As it turns out, Claire does not have the physical capacity to reach into cupboards or to lift objects such as pots or a tea kettle.) Nurses take Claire for short walks around the unit at least twice a day as she pushes a wheelchair in front of her. They note that walking even a few steps causes Claire pain and anxiety as she fears taking another fall. To allay her anxiety somewhat and to offset the risk of blood clots, a physiotherapist demonstrates stretching and flexibility exercises that Claire can do while sitting in a chair or lying in bed. The social worker, Jo, sets out to help Claire and her family assess what resources and supports she would need if she returned to her daughter&rsquo;s home. Daphne and her husband work long hours far from where they live. Therefore, Claire would need daily visits from a personal support worker to help her get dressed and bathed. She would need Meals on Wheels, transportation to medical appointments, telephone check-ins, visits from neighbours, and a medical alert bracelet. Jo exercises respect and diplomacy in helping Claire realize that returning to live in her daughter&rsquo;s home would require many adaptations and a certain degree of risk to her well-being. </p>
                            <p>The social worker visits Daphne&rsquo;s home to assess the physical environment. The home is a multi-level dwelling with bedrooms on the top floor. The open-concept main floor plan precludes setting up a bedroom for Claire on ground level. The stairs leading to the top level are angled in a way that poses a serious hazard for Claire. </p>
                            <p>To help bolster Claire&rsquo;s sense of self-direction and autonomy, Jo encourages her to draw up a list of pros and cons related to moving back to Daphne&rsquo;s house. One major disadvantage would be social isolation and inactivity. Claire has expressed a high need for social stimulation, and admits that she would not enjoy spending long hours each day sitting by herself watching television. She is also nervous about getting back and forth to the bathroom on her own. Two advantages of remaining in the long-term care setting are the constant social interaction and the continual monitoring of Claire&rsquo;s needs. </p>
                            <p>Jo, Claire, and Daphne discuss the long-term care facility&rsquo;s monthly fees and decide that they are affordable. </p>
                            <p>Claire reflects on the list she has made and then decides on her own that the risks involved in moving back to her daughter&rsquo;s home outweigh the benefits. She makes up her mind to look on the bright side as she adapts to her new circumstances. Jo works with Claire and her daughter&rsquo;s family to set up a schedule of regular visitors each week and to arrange family get-togethers at Daphne&rsquo;s home twice a week to help ease Claire&rsquo;s transition to life in a long-term care facility.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-366" class="ch-link"></a>As discussed in Chapter 6, palliative care is a specialized kind of holistic health care for individuals and families who are dealing with a life-threatening illness at an advanced stage. Those who provide palliative care strive to provide the best quality of life by ensuring that the dying individual&rsquo;s symptoms are managed while all possible steps are taken to maintain their comfort and dignity.</p>
                        <p>Palliative care offers a wide range of emotional, spiritual, and health-related support services. Madeleine Saint-Michel, a palliative care expert, emphasizes that a terminally ill person requires much more than physical comfort. They also need help in mindfully addressing the deep-seated emotions and feelings related to dying. While there are similarities in palliative care for all ages, palliative care for older adults presents some unique challenges, particularly for social workers.</p>
                        <p>Palliative care for older adults usually occurs in the person&rsquo;s home or in a long-term care facility where they have been living an average of two years before their death. In the latter case, teams are trained in basic palliative care strategies and they work alongside family members to ensure that the older loved one has a peaceful and dignified death. The Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association acknowledges, however, that this collaborative approach has not been fully incorporated into the culture of long-term care homes. Achieving this cultural shift, combined with more advanced training in palliative care, will be a leading priority in long-term care facilities over the next few years (Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association,&nbsp;2015).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Palliative Interventions</p>
                        <p>Palliative interventions attempt to provide relief from suffering at the end of life, and may include pain medication, oxygen, intravenous or nasogastric (through the nose) feeding, anti-nausea medication, and anti-anxiety medication. Palliative interventions can also include psychosocial support, such as counselling provided by a social worker, and spiritual support for both the patient and the family.</p>
                        <p>Two categories of palliative interventions have the potential to cause death: opioid use and terminal sedation. Opioids&mdash;a group of drugs that act on receptors in the brain to reduce pain&mdash;include morphine, codeine, heroin, fentanyl, and oxycodone. Opioids can depress respiration (breathing), which in some rare cases can be fatal, even when the opioids are being used appropriately. Terminal sedation is the practice of total sedation combined with the withholding or withdrawal of potentially life-sustaining artificial hydration and nutrition. Terminal sedation might be requested if a patient is imminently dying (within hours) and physical pain cannot be controlled in any other way, or if a patient is expected to die within a week, is not suffering physical pain, but is suffering mental anguish that cannot be controlled in any other way.</p>
                        <p>In Helen and Josef&rsquo;s story, a social worker must keep the client&rsquo;s right to autonomous decision making in the forefront despite pressure from family members to sway the individual&rsquo;s decision toward their preferred course of action.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-367" class="ch-link"></a>From an ethics standpoint, a social worker must respect each mentally competent individual&rsquo;s right to self-determination right up until the moment of death.</p>
                            <p>Josef is 88 and his wife Helen is 84. They have three children. Susan is an administrative assistant who lives in rural Nova Scotia in the same town as Josef and Helen. George is a lawyer living in Toronto and Jim is an actor living in Vancouver. Josef has had a series of mini-strokes during recent years. About five years ago, he and Helen decided that he needed more care than Helen could provide, so he moved into a nursing home.</p>
                            <p>The most recent mini-stroke has left Josef unable to walk, speak, or write. He has been moved to the rehabilitation ward of a local hospital. Helen&rsquo;s health is comparatively good for a woman of her age. She has some hearing and vision loss but her cognitive abilities and mobility are good overall. She looks after herself with the help of a homemaker. She is able to continue living in the family home and she visits Josef every day.</p>
                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A Complex Ethical Dilemma</p>
                            <p>Josef is not responding well to the treatment he is receiving for his latest mini-stroke. His doctor thinks it was likely a more substantial stroke than they had initially thought. Josef has had two choking spells in the last few days and a medical report indicates that he is at risk of having food lodge in his lungs if he continues to try to eat. This report has thrown the family into confusion regarding treatment for Josef.</p>
                            <p>A social worker, Nadya, is called in for a consultation with other interdisciplinary team members regarding Josef&rsquo;s inability to eat and Helen&rsquo;s distress in the face of this development. No one has yet contacted the couple&rsquo;s children to discuss their reactions to the latest medical report.</p>
                            <p>When this case is first assigned to her, Nadya thinks it seems quite straightforward&mdash;an older couple needs support to cope with a health-related difficulty. It gradually becomes clear, however, that this case involves complicated bioethical and psychological factors. Josef&rsquo;s level of care is now on the verge of becoming palliative, although no one has discussed this possibility with the couple or with the adult children.</p>
                            <p>Nadya is concerned about several issues. Is it possible for the doctors treating Josef to determine the likelihood of impending death? Is Josef willing to be fed intravenously or via nasogastric feeding? If not, will he consent to some level of sedation to offset both his physical and his mental suffering? Who holds power of attorney in deciding whether terminal sedation is administered to Josef? Has Josef documented his end-of-life wishes in the form of an advance directive?</p>
                            <p>To help address these questions, Nadya holds individual meetings with each family member as well as with some members of the health-care team. Josef is unable to communicate except by eye movement, but when he is told about the various medical reports, he indicates that he understands by blinking his eyes once for yes and twice for no.</p>
                            <p>Helen informs everyone that Josef has managed to tell her that he is ready to die and that he does not wish to have his life prolonged through artificial means. Understandably distraught, Helen and the adult children object to this decision and wish to persuade Josef to accept either intravenous or nasogastric&#160;feeding.</p>
                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Decision-Making Power</p>
                            <p>This case raises the issue of decision-making authority. To what extent can or should the medical team influence decision making one way or the other?</p>
                            <p>Is the medical team ethically bound to make every attempt to prolong Josef&rsquo;s life, even if these attempts contradict his express wish to die a dignified death rather than continue to suffer when there is no hope of&#160;recovery?</p>
                            <p>The social worker must listen carefully to each participant&rsquo;s opinions and beliefs&mdash;remembering that the principal client is Josef and that his wishes and rights are paramount.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, the social worker and the medical team sat down with Josef&rsquo;s family members to allow them to voice their fears and concerns. At the same time, they managed to gently guide the family to an understanding that Josef has an inviolable right to refuse invasive life-saving techniques and to choose how he spends his final days.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-368" class="ch-link"></a>As this social worker re-examines her career, two interwoven themes emerge: the need for advocacy for various groups, and the constant challenges involved in balancing personal, family, and professional priorities.</p>
                            <p>I am currently chair of Care Watch, a senior-run organization that advocates for quality home care in Ontario. I am also an active member of Concerned Friends, an organization that provides a voice for quality in long-term care for older adults.</p>
                            <p>Time spent as a teenager in Canadian Girls in Training inspired my desire to make a difference. While studying math and physics at Queen&rsquo;s University, I met my husband-to-be along with his mother and aunt, both of whom had social work experience. Another social worker in the family had published a journal article titled &ldquo;Reflections of a Radical Social Worker.&rdquo; Having learned about social work from knowing these women, I applied to the University of Toronto&rsquo;s School of Social Work after completing my undergraduate degree, and I was accepted at the age of 21.</p>
                            <p>Upon graduating from the M.S.W. program, I started work with the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society. Six years later, I left my job when I became pregnant. A year later, the YWCA hosted a &ldquo;liberation school&rdquo;&mdash;a day of workshops with childcare included! I joined the Board&rsquo;s Social Action Committee. It was focused on women&rsquo;s issues, including abortion, and I was soon appointed chair. The committee and the community were caught up in controversy; it was an exciting time. When the YWCA championed agencies&rsquo; rights to determine their own policies independently, I found myself chairing a major YWCA-hosted meeting. Given my volunteer commitments at that time, juggling full-time work while raising small children was not an option for me.</p>
                            <p>When my younger child was in school full time in 1987, I received a phone call from the executive director of Meals on Wheels. She remembered me from my volunteer work with the YWCA and persuaded me to return to work full time. The salary I was being offered was attractive, and I could leave work early two or three days a week to be home after school with my children. I applied for and got the job, and ended up managing community services, including social work, transportation, meals on wheels, and community dining.</p>
                            <p>Several years later, around the time my younger child went off to university, I decided to do something different. After two interviews with the City of Toronto, I accepted a position as the manager of programs and services at Seven Oaks Long-Term Care Home, where I stayed for ten years before retiring. The job included management of a range of programs to benefit long-term care residents, including social work, recreation, physiotherapy , occupational therapy, spiritual and religious care, and massage/aroma/music/art therapies.</p>
                            <p>At Seven Oaks I particularly enjoyed my work facilitating staff development. I forwarded job postings to colleagues, offered staff members time off to attend professional development workshops, and encouraged staff to move beyond their comfort zones in pursuit of better positions. In this way, careers advanced and clients were better served. In hindsight, I view my efforts as backroom advocacy&mdash;I was doing my best work behind the scenes.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy applying my skills&mdash;administrative, management, leadership, organizational, playing &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s advocate&rdquo;&mdash;to advance important causes, but I am not comfortable performing in the spotlight. In retirement, as chair of Care Watch, I moderate meetings, organize agendas, and supervise a staff member. I depend on others to front appointments with politicians, write blogs, and facilitate events. With Concerned Friends, I review and analyze Ministry of Health inspection reports for long-term care homes in Ontario.</p>
                            <p>Gerontological social workers often find that end-of-life issues are at the forefront, but they deal frequently with a wide range of life issues as well. Workers have a chance to influence the environments in which their clients live&mdash;for the better. Although systemic change is necessary, complex, and slow, it does happen, thanks to the work of dedicated and persistent advocates for older adults.</p>

                        <li>What kind of social work services do you believe are necessary for older adults to continue to live on their own? What are the roles of social workers in helping seniors “age in place”?</li>
                        <li>A major part of social work practice with older adults is helping them deal with end-of-life difficulties, including pain and spiritual and emotional questions. Discuss this topic in small groups and do a group presentation that depicts how social workers might assist older adults in hospice care. Include reflections on the kind of training that might help social workers in this type of work.</li>
                        <li>Write a brief response to the following comment by Dr. Chris Simpson, past president of the Canadian Medical Association: “We have emergency doctors treating patients in hallways because there are no beds. We have staff scrambling to free up beds. And we have social workers calling in favours to get a bed in a local nursing home.... We need a national seniors strategy to ensure that patients who are well enough to leave the hospital actually have some place to go. We need better home care and residential options so that we never again have to hear the term ‘bed-blocker.’”</li>
