                            <p class="text--caption">In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, newcomers to what is now Canada moved farther and farther westward, seeking land for agriculture and homesteads. This migration caused increasing displacement and conflict for the Indigenous peoples who lived on the land. The presence of Indigenous peoples on the lands desired by the settlers demanded a response from the European governments. The land’s original inhabitants were seen as “the Indian problem,” and impediments to “civilization.” Government officials devised various schemes to address the problem, including land-cession treaties and assimilationist policies. Such schemes came at an exorbitant cost to the original inhabitants, in terms of the loss of Indigenous lives and ways of living.</p>

                        <p><span class="span--keyword text--red"><a href="#" id="page-276" class="ch-link"></a>Indigenous peoples</span> (often synonymous with &ldquo;Aboriginal peoples&rdquo;) are the original inhabitants of the portion of the North American landmass known as Canada. &ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; are collective terms which include the First Nations, Inuit, and M&eacute;tis peoples. The term &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; is widely believed to have originated with the early explorers who thought they had reached India in their search for a passage to the east. Whether this is true or not, today the term is used to define a group of Indigenous people registered as such according to the <em>Indian Act.</em> Menno Boldt notes that the term Indian &ldquo;serves the Canadian government as a convenient political, legal, and administrative categorization of the culturally diverse first peoples of Canada&rdquo; (1993, 192). It is used in much the same way as &ldquo;native,&rdquo; as a means of &ldquo;outside-naming&rdquo; those &ldquo;who are descendants of the first inhabitants of what is now Canada.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; (and increasingly, the term &ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo;) &ldquo;appears to be associated with a general, emerging emancipation of Aboriginal peoples from domination of all sorts by the settler society&rdquo; (Chartrand, 1991: 3&ndash;4). Of course, these peoples have their own names in their respective languages, such as Anishinabe, Inuit, Innu, Nuu-chah-nulth, and M&eacute;tis.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">First Nations, Inuit, and M&eacute;tis</p>
                        <p>The First Nations include culturally, linguistically, and geographically diverse groups of people&mdash;some examples are the Cree, Dene, and Mi&rsquo;kmaq peoples. <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">The Indian Act of 1876 </span>sought strictly to define who would be considered an Indian so as to exert government authority over Aboriginal peoples. The Act fragmented the Aboriginal population into distinct groups with different rights, restrictions, and obligations. Because of the Indian Act and the significance of the Indian Register, the term &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; is still used in a legal context and usually defines a person as being either a Status or non-Status Indian.</p>
                        <p>Status Indians are persons of Aboriginal ancestry who are registered as Indians according to the Indian Act. Non-Status Indians are not, or have lost the right to be, registered as Indians as defined by the Act, but identify with the Indian community culturally and/or linguistically. Individuals who are &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; within this context are also First Nations people.</p>
                        <p>The Inuit are Aboriginal peoples of Canada &ldquo;that have traditionally used and occupied, and currently use and occupy, the lands and waters ranging from the Yukon and Northwest Territories to northern Qu&eacute;bec (Nunavik) and Labrador (Nunatsiavut) (INAC and Tungavik, 1993: 4). April 1, 1999, marked the creation of Nunavut, a new territory created from the eastern part of the Northwest Territories. The agreement between the Inuit of Nunavut and the federal government recognizes that the Inuit are best able to define who is an Inuk (or member of the Inuit peoples) according to their own understanding of themselves.</p>
                        <p>The term &ldquo;M&eacute;tis&rdquo; is most often used to refer to descendants of the historic M&eacute;tis&mdash;those whose origin can be traced back to the Red River in the early 1800s. Now located mainly in the prairies and the north, they formed a language and culture that was a unique blend of Indian and European cultures (Purich, 1988). On April 14, 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that both non-Status Indians and M&eacute;tis are now considered &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; under the Constitution. This means that both groups are now the responsibility of the federal government and not the provinces. Although this decision is being hailed as a victory by those affected, its repercussions on new federal funding opportunities for M&eacute;tis and non-Status Indians remain to be seen.</p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#" id="page-277" class="ch-link"></a>When Europeans began to arrive on this continent, Indigenous peoples numbered between 500,000 and 2 million. They lived a wide variety of lifestyles, depending on the natural resources available to them. The oral traditions of some Indigenous cultures assert that the pre-contact population was even greater than the estimates of anthropologists and historians. Across Canada, there were approximately 50 Indigenous languages spoken, which made up 11 main language groups. Within each Indigenous language, there are several dialects. For example, the Algonkian (or Algonquian) language group includes the Ojibwa language, which in turn includes the Saulteaux, Odawa, Potawatomi, and other dialects.</p>
                        <p>Indigenous nations were also characterized by diverse systems of governance, health care practices, and cultural and spiritual rituals. These social aspects were not separated into functionally specialized institutions, but were organized holistically. Such social organization usually included some formal means by which different nations agreed to coexist. Some, such as the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) or the Mi&rsquo;kmaq, formed confederacies. Much of Indigenous history is based on unwritten oral accounts passed down over generations. These accounts often contain spiritual concepts foreign to European experience.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between Indigenous peoples and Europeans was initially friendly. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Indigenous peoples served as partners in exploration and trade. Later, as the English and French became locked in a struggle to control North America, the relationship with the Indigenous peoples evolved into military alliances. As European peoples and their governments exerted dominance over territories that had been inhabited by Indigenous peoples, they were no longer seen as military allies, but were gradually viewed as irrelevant, or worse, as an obstacle to imperial domination (Miller, 1989: 84).</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Indian Act</p>
                        <p>With the signing of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">land-cession treaties</span> in the later nineteenth century, the government of Canada changed its relationship with the continent&rsquo;s first inhabitants. &ldquo;The intention of the civil government, now that Indians no longer were militarily useful, was to concentrate Indians in settled areas, or reserves; to subject them to as much proselytization, schooling, and instruction in agriculture as &lsquo;circumstances&rsquo; made necessary&rdquo; (Miller, 1989: 100).</p>
                        <p>The legal instrument for colonialization was the Indian Act. Canada today is one of the few countries to still have separate laws for a specific group based on race or ethnicity. The Indian Act was, and still is, a piece of social legislation of very broad scope that regulates and controls virtually every aspect of the lives of Indigenous peoples.</p>
                        <p>Historically, an <span class="span--keyword text--red">Indian Agent</span> administered the Act in Indigenous communities. These agents were to displace traditional Indigenous leaders so as to institute a new way of living consistent with the intentions of the Canadian government at the time. The Indian Agents had extraordinary administrative and discretionary powers. In order to ensure this, Clause 25 of the Act established the government&rsquo;s guardianship over Indian lands. The Indian Act, still in force, certainly seems to be wildly out of step with the bulk of Canadian law. It singles out a segment of society (largely on the basis of race) removes much of their land and property from the commercial mainstream, and gives the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs and other government officials a degree of discretion that is not only intrusive but frequently offensive.</p>
                        <p>Many want the Act abolished because it violates normative standards of equality; others want First Nations to be able to make their own decisions and see the Act as inhibiting that freedom. Even within its provisions, others see unfair treatment between, for example, Indians who live on reserves and those who reside elsewhere. In short, this is a statute of which few speak well. However, for fear of losing much-needed special status, some Indigenous groups seek to protect the Act.</p>

                                    <a href="#" id="page-279" class="ch-link"></a>While land treaties differed in their terms and complexity, they generally aimed to force Indigenous peoples to surrender land to the Canadian government. The major treaties were signed in the West, starting with Treaty No. 1 in 1871 and ending with Treaty No. 10 in 1906. (Treaty No. 11 was signed in the Far North.) These ten treaties allowed the vast territories of the West to be settled and the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed. It is important to note that no treaties were signed between the First Nations of Québec, the Maritimes, and most of British Columbia. In fact, almost half of the population of Registered Indians did not sign land treaties. Treaties and other land claims are now disputed across the country.</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Assimilationist Policies</p>
                        <p>The social control aspects of the Indian Act placed Canada&rsquo;s First Nations firmly in the position of a colonized people. The Act spelled out a process of enfranchisement, whereby Indians could acquire full Canadian citizenship only by relinquishing their ties to their community; that is, by giving up their culture and traditions and any rights to land. Thus, the cost of Canadian citizenship demanded of an Aboriginal person far surpassed that for an immigrant to Canada.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian government saw the Indian Act as a temporary measure to control Indigenous peoples until they had been fully assimilated through enfranchisement. (Assimilation refers to the absorbing of one cultural group into another.) It was not until 1960, however, that the federal government granted First Nations the right to vote in federal elections. This decision was important in that both enfranchised and non-enfranchised Indigenous peoples now had the right to vote in federal elections. For the first time, citizenship for Indigenous peoples was not conditional upon their assimilation into mainstream Canadian society. Despite this move, however, the federal government remained opposed to Indigenous self-government.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-280" class="ch-link">Once land was ceded and Canadian</a> settlements had been established, Aboriginal peoples were shunted aside onto small parcels of land largely devoid of any economic potential. This land could not even be used as collateral to develop business ventures, since that land was held &ldquo;in trust&rdquo; by the government. It has been argued that by confining Aboriginal peoples to reserves, Inuit communities, and M&eacute;tis settlements</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                        	<p>the welfare of Aboriginal societies was systematically neglected. Famines and tuberculosis were allowed to virtually decimate Aboriginal communities, unaided except for relocation of survivors to state institutions. Housing provided was of the poorest quality, and health care and education were, until quite recently, left to the Church. (Scott, 1994: 7)</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>The federal government then established the Department of Indian Affairs as the main vehicle to regulate and control Aboriginal movement and ways of living. The modern equivalent of the department is known as Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), and its stated mission is to support Aboriginal communities in their quest to become healthy, safe, and economically self-sufficient.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The M&eacute;tis and the Inuit</p>
                        <p>The situation among the M&eacute;tis in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was unique. The M&eacute;tis in western Canada could seek to become status Indians by aligning themselves to certain treaty areas or they could &ldquo;take scrip.&rdquo; The <span class="span--keyword text--red">scrip system</span> entitled the bearer of a scrip certificate to either land or money; in exchange, the person who took scrip gave up all further claims to land. Although the scrip system offered to the M&eacute;tis was different from the treaty-making process for First Nations, the result was the same. Neither M&eacute;tis nor First Nations were treated fairly (Purich, 1988).</p>
                        <p>The Indian Act also governed the Inuit. No land was formally set aside for their use, nor were any treaties signed with the Inuit peoples. However, because of the extensive mineral and oil exploration on their lands, many Inuit communities have been relocated, forcing a substantial change in their lifestyles.</p>
                        <p>One event that fostered deep distrust on the part of Inuit people toward the Canadian government was the 1950s Inuit relocation experiment from Northern Quebec&rsquo;s Ungava peninsula to Ellesmere and Cornwallis Islands in the High Arctic. In 1953 and 1955, the Canadian government forcibly relocated eleven Inuit families from the Port Harris region and four families from Pond Inlet to new communities at Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay. The relocated families suffered great hardship in the new region, however, despite the Canadian government&rsquo;s promises of improved hunting and trapping. Hunting and shelter were scarce, winters were darker, and because only a few youth were brought into the new community, partnership options were limited. Many Inuit individuals perished during the beginning of the relocation experiment, although most survived through fierce adaptation.</p>
                        <p>Another example of the paternalistic nature of state intervention in Inuit lives is the disc list system. As bureaucrats could not, or perhaps would not, acknowledge Inuktitut names, the <span class="span--keyword text--red">disc list system</span> assigned a numbered disc to each Inuk. Although originating as an administrative measure in the 1920s and not universally employed, the disc list system ultimately came to define a quasi-legal status that affected all aspects of Inuit life. By the 1960s, however, &ldquo;it was evident that Government&rsquo;s attempts to implement a &lsquo;disc list&rsquo; system was largely a failure&rdquo; (Smith, 1992).</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-281" class="ch-link"></a>Most Canadians are aware of the forced removal of Indigenous children from their communities and reserves and their placement in church-run, government-funded residential schools, which operated from the 1870s to the 1990s and were designed to assimilate the students into mainstream society. But fewer have heard the term &ldquo;Sixties Scoop,&rdquo; coined by a social worker who reported in a government study that it was common practice in British Columbia in the mid-1960s to &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; almost all newborns from their mothers on reserves. Advocates say the removal of these children from their communities had devastating consequences, including high rates of depression, suicide , poverty, low education, unemployment, and incarceration.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey" id="kc-8">The Residential School System</p>
                        <p>The now-infamous <span class="span--keyword text--red">residential school system</span> was established in the mid-1800s by Indian Affairs in conjunction with several Christian churches. By restricting Indigenous culture and language, the schools sought to fulfill the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-9">assimilationist policies</span> of the federal government. The children were denied their language, spiritual rituals, and more importantly, access to their families. Indigenous children were regularly subjected to emotional and physical abuse, and many were also victims of sexual abuse.</p>
                        <p>As a result of having resided within an institution that regulated every aspect of their lives, these individuals had impaired decision-making skills: &ldquo;residential schools were no preparation for life in any type of community&rdquo; (Armitage, 1993: 142). Some struggled with drug and alcohol use and problems with mental health that arose from the psychological trauma they had endured. Many found themselves with a limited ability to parent their own children, as parenting models had been unavailable to them. While many individuals who emerged from these institutions retained a positive outlook, a true testament to their adaptability and resilience, it must be stressed that the residential school experience systematically damaged many Indigenous children and families. This legacy will take many generations to heal.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey" id="kc-10">The Sixties Scoop</p>
                        <p>In 1951, the Indian Act was amended such that provincial laws of application (and therefore child welfare legislation) applied to reserves (Timpson, 1990). With this legislative change, the government&rsquo;s approach to Indigenous assimilation veered from residential schools toward the apprehension and placement of Indigenous children in non-Indigenous foster homes. Child welfare agencies also assumed responsibility for services to Indigenous communities.</p>
                        <p>One result is what is known as the <span class="span--keyword text--red">Sixties Scoop.</span> In the 1960s, massive numbers of children were removed from their communities and placed in non-Indigenous foster and adoptive homes. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, at any given time, one in seven Status Indian children was not in the care of his or her parents, and as many as one in four Status Indian children was spending at least some time away from the parental home (Armitage 1993, 147).</p>
                        <p>The Sixties Scoop was widely condemned in the mid-1980s after ongoing criticism that included a judicial inquiry, headed by Manitoba Judge Edwin Kimelman. The inquiry led to policy changes signalling a need for more culturally sensitive legislation and a move toward Indigenous-controlled child and family service agencies. &ldquo;Cultural genocide has taken place in a systematic, routine manner,&rdquo; Kimelman wrote. &ldquo;The miracle is that there were not more children lost in this system run by so many well-intentioned people. The road to hell was paved with good intentions, and the child welfare system was the paving contractor.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Most Indigenous child welfare agencies have adopted placement protocols that specify placement preferences: first, with the extended family; second, with Indigenous members of the community with the same cultural and linguistic identification; and third, alternative Indigenous caregivers.

                        <p>The Sixties Scoop has given birth to what some call the &ldquo;Millennium Scoop,&rdquo; referring to the high rates of Indigenous children in care today. According to Statistics Canada, of the 30,000 children aged 14 and under in Canadian foster care in 2011, almost half were Indigenous. These children are part of the legacy of disrupted parent-child bonds caused by past assimilationist practices such as the residential school system, which robbed generations of Indigenous peoples of their language, their heritage, their personal histories, and their cultural identity.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-284" class="ch-link"></a>Canada’s homicide rate has sunk to its lowest level since 1966—but Indigenous people are far more likely to be murder victims than other segments of the population.</p>
                                            <p>In its first-ever complete analysis on homicides and Aboriginal identity, Statistics Canada said that last year [2014], Indigenous people were about six times more likely to be victims of homicide than non-Indigenous people. Almost a quarter of last year’s 516 homicide victims were reported by police as Aboriginal, a group that accounted for just five percent of the Canadian population.</p>
                                            <p>Indigenous women in Canada are roughly seven times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be slain by serial killers, a Globe analysis has found.</p>
                                            <p>Both Indigenous men and women are more likely to be victims of murder. Aboriginal men were seven times more likely to be homicide victims than non-Aboriginal men, while the homicide rate for Indigenous women was six times higher than for their non-Indigenous counterparts.</p>
                                            <p>The agency also recorded the number of Aboriginal female homicide victims between 1980 and 2014. It counted 1,073 in that time, accounting for 16 percent of all female victims (not including the number of missing Indigenous women).</p>
                                            <p>The findings by a national statistical agency confirm what some have been saying for years: that an alarmingly disproportionate number of murder victims are Aboriginal.</p>
                                            <p>“This is helpful and important because it confirms exactly what we’ve been saying,” said Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women’s Association of Canada, which has spent years collecting data and raising awareness on missing and murdered Aboriginal women.</p>
                                            <p>“Until recently, people have said this is anecdotal, or there’s no hard data to prove your accusations. This is important because our work has often been discounted as not valid. There is no way this can be ignored.”</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Indigenous Women at Higher Risk of Violent&#160;Victimization</p>
                                            <p>A <em>Globe and Mail</em> investigation revealed this week that Indigenous women in Canada are about seven times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be slain by serial killers. Indigenous women are also at a far higher risk of violent victimization, a separate Statscan release on Monday showed. Aboriginal women had a rate of 115 sexual assaults per 1,000 women in 2014, more than triple the rate of non-Aboriginal women.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Girls and Women</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-285" class="ch-link"></a>The release comes after a 2014 RCMP report, which found that 1,181 Aboriginal women were killed or went missing between 1980 and 2012. An update this year counted another 32 homicides of Indigenous women in RCMP jurisdictions during the previous two years.</p>
                                            <p>The federal Liberal government plans to launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada by the summer [2016].</p>
                                            <p>Statscan has been working with the RCMP to improve data quality on murdered Aboriginal women amid a growing public focus on the issue. As well, as of last year [2014], police services in Canada began reporting Aboriginal identity of all victims and accused people to the statistical agency. Statscan said it will continue to collect this data, adding that beginning next year [2016], it will also start tracking whether the victim was reported as missing to police prior to the homicide.</p>
                                            <p>“In response to increasing efforts in Canada to address societal concerns regarding the prevalence of missing and murdered Aboriginal girls and women, the policing community has amended their policies which prevented the reporting of Aboriginal identity of victims and persons accused of homicide to [Statscan’s] homicide survey,” the agency said in an email.</p>
                                            <p>The RCMP said they no longer plan to release annual stats on missing and murdered Aboriginal women. The data collected so far “provide us with enough information and insights on the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women to guide our investigations and prevention efforts,” it said in an email to <em>The&#160;Globe</em>.</p>
                                            <p>Aboriginal women account for a growing share of female homicide victims in Canada—21 percent last year, compared with 14 percent in 1991. That increase is because the number of Indigenous victims has held steady, while it has been falling among non-Aboriginal female victims since 1991.</p>
                                            <p>This is the first time the agency has completed police-reported data on Aboriginal identity of victims and those accused of homicide. The 2014 homicide data show Aboriginal people are “over-represented as victims and persons accused of homicide,” the agency said.</p>
                                            <p>It found almost a third of people accused of these crimes last year were Aboriginal. The rate of Aboriginal people accused was ten times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous people.</p>
                                            <p>The elevated rates of violence reflect complex and long-standing systemic problems that include poverty, racism and discrimination in the justice system, noted Dr. Lavell-Harvard.</p>
                                            <p>Among provinces, the rate of homicides involving Aboriginal victims was highest in Manitoba, followed by Alberta, and lowest in Québec. For the population as a whole, there were four more homicides in 2014 than a year earlier. The homicide rate, however, was stable, which meant 2013 and 2014 tallied the lowest homicide rates since 1966. Among the total population, Manitoba had the highest homicide rate in Canada for the eighth straight year, though it saw a decline last year.</p>
                                            <p>Among cities, Thunder Bay, in northern Ontario, had the highest homicide rate in Canada—nearly three times that of Winnipeg, which recorded the second-highest level in the&#160;country.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-286" class="ch-link"></a>Indigenous researchers have put forth the theory of &ldquo;historic trauma&rdquo; to describe the consequences of numerous stressors experienced by whole communities over generations, such as the trauma caused by residential schools in Canada. The theory argues that such traumatic events (and adaptive or maladaptive responses to it) eventually become imbedded in the shared memories of Indigenous communities and are passed on to successive generations through storytelling, community interaction and communication, and patterns of parenting.</p>
                        <p>The <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-11">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP)</span> of 1996 brought together six years of research and public consultation on Aboriginal issues (Canada, 1996). It was the most comprehensive distillation of such material ever published, and provided a factual basis for beginning to address the historic trauma inflicted on Canada&rsquo;s Indigenous peoples. Among other issues, the report examined the need for Indigenous peoples to heal from the consequences of domination, displacement, and assimilation. The RCAP concluded that the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples for the last 400 years has been built on &ldquo;false premises&rdquo;: government policies, which were always presented as beneficial, have invariably resulted in harm. The foundation for a renewed relationship, according to the RCAP, involves recognizing Aboriginal nations as political entities. Unfortunately, many of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations were never implemented.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey" id="kc-12">The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement</p>
                        <p>In 2007, another effort to address historic trauma was implemented. The settlement package between the Government of Canada, various Churches, and Canada&rsquo;s Aboriginal peoples, called the <span class="span--keyword text--red">Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA),</span> is the largest class-action settlement in Canadian history. The agreement includes the following:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A Common Experience Payment for all eligible former students of a recognized Indian Residential School, based on the number of years of residency ($10,000 for the first school year or portion thereof and $3,000 for each subsequent year)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>To achieve resolution regarding the residential schools experience, the Aboriginal Healing Foundation proposed that four components were necessary:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Acknowledgement.</span> Naming the harmful acts and admitting that the acts were wrong.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p> In 2008, the federal government formally apologized to Indigenous peoples for the residential school system.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission</p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="#" id="page-287" class="ch-link"></a>Following the announcement of the IRSSA, the newly-established <span class="span--keyword text--red">Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)</span> spent six years travelling across Canada hearing from Indigenous persons who had been taken from their families as children and placed in residential schools. The TRC&rsquo;s mandate was to create an accurate historic record about residential schools and their impact on former students, and then share this record with the public. Once the truth had been determined, the process of reconciliation could begin. In other words, &ldquo;Now that we know about residential schools and their legacy, what do we do about it?&ldquo;</p>
                        <p>The TRC&rsquo;s final report was released in December 2015 and included 94 &ldquo;calls to action&rdquo;: sweeping changes to child welfare, education, and health-care systems; recognition of Indigenous language and cultural rights; an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women; and changes to public institutions to give greater recognition and visibility to Indigenous sovereignty and histories. In fact, one of the report&rsquo;s main messages is that</p>
                        <p>too many Canadians know little or nothing about the deep historical roots of these conflicts. This lack of historical knowledge has serious consequences... In government circles, it makes for poor public policy decisions. In the public realm, it reinforces racist attitudes and fuels civic distrust between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians (TRC, 2015: 8).</p>
                        <p>In 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to implement all 94 of the TRC&rsquo;s recommendations. This will require collaboration between provincial and federal governments, as well as a quick and efficient response by public institutions (McSheffrey, 2015). But it is a second chance to address the historic trauma caused by residential schools and to work toward reconciliation among former students, their families and communities, and all Canadians.</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><span>(1) Truth </span><span>Telling</span></p>
                                            <p>Begins with a full and truthful accounting of child welfare respecting Indigenous children, youth, and families. This would include identifying past and current harms experienced by Indigenous children, families, and communities, and must be told from both non-Indigenous and Indigenous perspectives. Truth telling gives voice to, and recognizes, past harm, obliges it to be heard, and sets the scene for restoration.</p>
                                            <p>Requires non-Indigenous and Indigenous peoples to acknowledge and accept responsibility for redressing the wrongs done to Indigenous children, youth, families, and communities, regardless of their degree of direct involvement.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">(2) Acknowledging</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Affirms the child welfare practices of Indigenous people, and the values that guide them.</li>
                                                <li>Adopts equality, fairness, and balance as essential guidelines to child welfare.</li>
                                                <li>Respects the intrinsic right of Indigenous peoples to define their own cultural identity.</li>
                                                <li>Brings alive a new understanding about child welfare between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.</li>
                                                <li>Asserts that Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples can follow a new path in the future—a path that reflects learning from the past and a renewed sense of mutual respect.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">(3) Restoring</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Provides an opportunity for those who have done past harm to work in a respectful and trustworthy way with those who have experienced the harm to design and implement earnest steps to redress past harms and set frameworks in place to prevent their recurrence.</li>
                                                <li>Involves an ongoing process whereby Indigenous and non-Indigenous people take mutual responsibility for child welfare and its outcomes.</li>
                                                <li>Guards against the human tendency to revert to past practices when something new becomes difficult or&#160;uncertain.</li>
                                                <li>Builds personal and community capacity for addressing past wrongs and current child welfare problems, and for promoting child and youth well-being.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                <li>Recognizes that reconciliation is not a one-time event or pronouncement but rather an investment in a new way of being and a relationship to achieve a broader goal: a child welfare system that supports the safety and well-being of Indigenous children and youth.</li>
                                                <li>Requires Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to work jointly to implement a set of core values, a vision, and a structure for best practice.</li>
                                                <li>Commits professionals and others to continue the journey of reconciliation—especially when energy and focus are diverted elsewhere.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>Notably, the Touchstones of Hope process is also transferable across a variety of areas, including health care, education, research, and knowledge sharing in various contexts.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-290" class="ch-link"></a>Indigenous peoples across Canada are finding their own voice and, with that, pursuing the goal of establishing political, financial, and moral control over their lives. A dialogue and partnership with the rest of Canada in addressing the issues facing their communities is slowly evolving, whether those communities are on traditional lands or within urban centres.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most important in this process is the reaffirmation of Indigenous rights to land, rights that are inextricably linked to the principle of <span class="span--keyword text--red">Indigenous self-government.</span> Such an affirmation is one of the key recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the foremost demand of Indigenous leaders. Indigenous peoples are seeking the formal recognition of rights that already exist, rights that existed prior to the European incursions.</p>
                        <p>An important factor today is the tenacious resistance on the part of Indigenous peoples, over a very long period of time, to all efforts to eradicate both them and their distinct ways of living. Also important are Indigenous economic development initiatives, the resurgence of Indigenous languages, the establishment of Indigenous education with a culturally based curriculum, the development of working models of Indigenous justice systems, and Indigenous control of social services that are no longer based exclusively on the mainstream social work model but are increasingly integrating an Indigenous approach to social work practice. All these developments create a path that will allow Indigenous people their rightful place in Canadian society.</p>
                        <p>The resurgence of Indigenous political activism that began in the 1970s has helped advance this process of redefinition. It has led to the development of several national organizations representing and uniting distinct constituent groups. Among these organizations are: (1) the Assembly of First Nations, which represents First Nations in Canada; (2) the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, representing Canada&rsquo;s Inuit population; (3) the M&eacute;tis National Council; (4) the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, representing off-reserve Aboriginal peoples; and (5) the Native Women&rsquo;s Association of Canada. These organizations are generally affiliated with provincial/territorial and local groups that lobby the Canadian government to develop policies to protect the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples&mdash;rights guaranteed in section 35 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They also seek to educate governments and Canadians about the issues facing Indigenous peoples.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Idle No More: A Grassroots Protest Movement</p>
                        <p>In addition to national organizations, grassroots movements strive to uphold Indigenous rights. One such movement is Idle No More, an ongoing protest movement founded in December 2012. It comprises the First Nations, M&eacute;tis, and Inuit peoples and their non-Indigenous supporters in Canada, and to a lesser extent, internationally. It began in November, 2012, when three First Nations women and one non-Native ally in Saskatchewan&mdash;Nina Wilson, Sheelah Mclean, Sylvia McAdam, and Jessica Gordon&mdash;held the first community teach-in about proposed omnibus federal legislation, Bill C-45. This bill threatened protection of water and forests and proposed the leasing of First Nations territory&mdash;which protesters perceived to be in the interests of the Northern Gateway pipeline project. Idle No More has involved a number of political actions worldwide, inspired in part by the liquid diet hunger strike of former Attawapiskat (First Nations) Chief Theresa Spence and further coordinated via social media. While round dances in malls, marches, hunger fasts on Victoria Island, and calls for resistance to fast-tracked omnibus legislation have subsided, there is now more collective action led by Indigenous grassroots peoples throughout Canada than ever before.</p>

Increasing graduation rates for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis students at the postsecondary level is an important part of the challenge. This is a human rights imperative, and—as census evidence shows—a “no-brainer” policy priority for governments and post-secondary institutions.</p>
                                            <p>Less than 50 percent of Aboriginal peoples aged 25 to 64 without a high-school education are employed. For Aboriginal high-school graduates, employment levels rise to 67 percent, to 75 percent for college graduates, and to 84 percent for those with bachelor’s degrees. The employment rate for non-Aboriginal Canadians with a bachelor’s degree? 83 percent. Gap, and case, closed.</p>
                                            <p>Income results are similarly striking. Aboriginal peoples with a high-school certificate earn on average $36,000 per year. Those holding a bachelor’s degree average $55,000 a year, while those with a master’s degree average $67,000, rising to $71,000 for those with a Ph.D.</p>
                                            <p>Put simply, post-secondary education (PSE) matters for addressing income inequality and fulfilling economic potential for Aboriginal Canadians, making all of Canada better off.</p>
                                            <p>But despite growing numbers of First Nations, Inuit, and Métis university graduates, the gap with the rest of the population continues to grow. Only eight percent of Aboriginal adults aged 25 to 64 have a university degree, while that figure is 23 percent for the rest of the population.</p>
                                            <p>We must build Aboriginal students’ high-school graduation rates, ensuring effective financial, social, and cultural supports at the elementary and secondary levels, as well as supports for the transition to PSE. The level of federal funding to support Aboriginal students attending post-secondary institutions has increased only two percent a year since 1996—while tuition and the cost of living have been rising faster. And there are more Aboriginal students to support because of growth in the Aboriginal population. The cap on government resources must be lifted.</p>
                                            <p>But the challenge and promise of reconciliation for the postsecondary sector is not just about enabling more Aboriginal students to graduate. A comprehensive approach is required, including taking responsibility for past actions and fundamentally challenging our institutions and practices to create possibilities for healthier relationships.</p>
                                            <p>Curricula, programs, and the full range of university services must better promote and respect Indigenous knowledge, experiences, and world views so all students may learn and benefit from exchange and understanding. University faculties, administrative staff, and governance structures must evolve to better support participation and leadership by Aboriginal scholars and traditional knowledge holders.</p>
                                            <p>Encouragingly, a growing number of universities and colleges across Canada are stepping up to the plate. The University of Saskatchewan, for example, has committed to rigorous programs for Aboriginal student success, inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and experience in curricular offerings, and intercultural engagement among faculty, staff, and students. The University of Manitoba has issued a formal apology to residential school survivors and established the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.</p>
                                            <p>Fundamentally, as a sector, we must listen, talk, and listen some more. Dialogue and interaction between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students, faculty, and community members must underpin the co-creation of new futures.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-292" class="ch-link"></a>Many non-Indigenous social workers want to know how they can help advocate for Indigenous children, youth, and communities. There is no easy answer to this question because so many of the past attempts made to “help” Indigenous children and families have had disastrous results. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) recommends that before entering the profession, social workers gain a thorough knowledge of residential schools and other ways in which Indigenous people have been—and continue to be—subjected to unfair government policies and programs (TRC, 2015).</p>
                                            <p>It is also important to be aware of the current issues facing Indigenous communities. For example, Census 2006 data indicate that the First Nations unemployment rate was nearly three times the rate for non-Aboriginal people (18 versus 6.3 percent). It also shows that the median income was much lower for First Nations people than for non-Aboriginal people: in 2006, the median income for First Nations people was $14,477, but $25,955 for non-Aboriginal people. In reserve communities, the discrepancies were even more noticeable: the unemployment rate in 2006 was 25 percent, and the median income was only $11,223 (Statistics Canada, 2006).</p>
                                            <p>In addition, First Nations peoples on reserve are four times more likely than non-Aboriginal people to live in a home needing major repairs (28 versus 7 percent). Many families live in unhealthy and crowded conditions, without basic resources such as clean drinking water or working toilets and sewage systems. Residents are thus exposed to infectious molds, bacteria, accidental injury, emotional stress, and health problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and tuberculosis (Allan and Smylie, 2015; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2008).</p>
                                            <p>The fact is that poverty on reserves and in northern Inuit communities is not an individual problem. The living conditions are beyond the control of local leadership because access to funding and other resources necessary to make improvements is complicated by the existence of various government jurisdictions. For example, the provisions in the Indian Act make the federal government responsible for First Nations housing and infrastructure, including health care, but provincial governments are responsible for social assistance and other social services. Without a good system of coordination, projects to improve quality of life can often only be implemented in a piecemeal fashion (Allan and Smylie, 2015).</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Advocacy Initiatives</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-293" class="ch-link"></a>Several advocacy initiatives have aimed to address the systemic factors that undermine the health and well-being of Indigenous families. One recent success is the 2016 Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling that the federal government has been discriminating against First Nations on reserve by supporting unfair funding models for child welfare services. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.fncaringsociety.com/">the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society website.</a></p>
                                            
                                            <p>Another example of advocacy work is an initiative by the Ontario Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. With the support of First Nations leadership and federal and provincial members of the Intergovernmental Network, the Office brought together youth from 62 First Nations communities for five days in 2013 to discuss issues of concern (Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, 2014).</p>
                                            <p>Five of the youth wrote and implemented an action plan that stemmed from this meeting. They identified several themes to work on, including the impacts of residential schools, culture and identity, quality of education, suicide, youth opportunity and leadership, and sustainable funding (ibid.).</p>
                                            <p>Indigenous communities have also done a great deal of work to advocate for culturally appropriate healing interventions. The Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF) worked with communities and other stakeholders from 1998 to 2014 to develop evidenced-based programming and frameworks that would address intergenerational traumas; “healing, in Aboriginal terms, refers to personal and societal recovery from the lasting effects of oppression and systemic racism suffered over generations” (Aboriginal Healing Foundation, 2006: 7).</p>
                                            <p>The integration of an Indigenous world view into the planning and integration of activities—as well as the three pillars of legacy education, cultural interventions, and therapeutic healing—are listed as best practices in addressing intergenerational traumas among youth (ibid.).</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Forming Alliances Through Reconciliation</p>
                                            <p>To ensure that the Truth and Reconciliation Committee recommendations are implemented on a broad scale, all levels of government, as well as school boards and universities, will need to make reconciliation a priority.</p>
                                            <p>A number of youth organizations have been leading the way by taking on the important role of bringing together Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth, their families, and their communities to discuss the impacts of residential schools and of other practices and policies that have harmed Indigenous&#160;communities.</p>
                                            <p>For example, Canada Roots and the Assembly of Seven Generations use group theatre activities such as the “Blanket Exercise” (shown below) to help teach the impacts of colonization. Blankets on the floor represent Canada before the arrival of European explorers and settlers. Participants representing Indigenous peoples begin by moving around on the blankets. While a narrator reads from a script, other participants—representing European newcomers—interact with those standing on the blankets. At the end of the exercise, only a few people remain on the blankets, which have been folded into small bundles and now cover only a fraction of their original area.</p>
                                            <p>The University of Winnipeg and Lakehead University have been the first to make learning about Indigenous histories and cultures a requirement of graduation. Several school boards in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia are adopting treaty education as part of their curricula as well.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">How Can Social Workers Show Themselves to Be Allies?</p>
                                            <p>In the context of reconciliation, it is important to understand the meaning of the word “allies” and how it relates to improving relationships with Indigenous peoples. The word “allies” has been defined as “people who recognize the unearned privilege they receive from society’s patterns of injustice and take responsibility for changing these patterns” (from the Becoming an Ally website).</p>
                                            <p>Respecting Indigenous sovereignty, learning about treaties, questioning and resisting racist stereotypes (including sports team names and mascots), learning about the people who are native to wherever you are, and learning about and supporting Indigenous programs and organizations are just a few of the ways that social workers can show themselves to be allies (Neighbours of the Onondaga Nation).</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-294" class="ch-link"></a>Many people assume that being Indigenous and urban living do not go together; however, many Indigenous people have lived in cities for generations. According to the 2011 census, 53&#160;percent of Indigenous people (those identifying as First Nations, M&eacute;tis, or Inuit) now live in Canadian cities. As of 2011, the largest urban Indigenous populations were in Winnipeg and Vancouver with 78, 415 and 52, 375 people respectively identifying as Indigenous (Statistics Canada, 2012; StatsCan, 2005).</p>
                        <p>The largest survey of urban Indigenous peoples is the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-15">Urban Aboriginal Peoples Study</span> (UAPS-2010), in which interviews were conducted with 2,614 individuals aged 18 or older who self-identified as First Nations (Status or non-Status), M&eacute;tis, or Inuit across ten cities in Canada, including Montr&eacute;al. This comprehensive study surveyed participants about issues such as place of origin, reasons for moving to urban locations, the importance of culture, and experiences with Indigenous and non-Indigenous service providers in urban locations (Environics Institute, 2010).</p>
                        <p>The UAPS looked at generational differences among participants; Inuit (87 percent) were most likely to be first-generation residents, followed by Status First Nations people (75 percent), M&eacute;tis (62 percent), and non-Status First Nations people (58 percent). Older people (77 percent of those aged 45 and older) were more likely than younger people (60 percent of those aged 18 to 24 and 64 percent of those aged 25 to 44) to be &ldquo;first-generation&rdquo; urban Indigenous peoples (Environics Institute, 2010). Among first-generation urban dwellers, the most frequently cited reasons that participants gave for moving to a city were to be closer to family and to pursue education and employment opportunities (Environics Institute, 2010).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Development of Urban Indigenous Organizations</p>
                        <p>Urban Indigenous organizations first emerged as community clubs and then social service organizations in the 1950s. In the 1960s, there were only three &ldquo;Indian and M&eacute;tis Friendship Centres,&rdquo; but by 1968, there were 26, and by 2002, there were 117 such organizations. The clubs were said to provide a sense of community, a meeting place, and a more visible Indigenous presence in urban areas (Newhouse and Peters, 2001). In addition to Native Friendship Centres, many cities now have a number of Indigenous-specific cultural and artistic centres, healing centres, health and social service organizations, First Peoples&rsquo; centres at universities, employment services, and other special initiatives and committees (Environics Institute, 2010; Montr&eacute;al Urban Aboriginal Health Committee (MUAHC), 2012).</p>
                        <p>Social work with urban Indigenous populations might look very different depending on how long someone has lived in the city, the degree to which culturally-specific services are important to them, whether they speak an Indigenous language (and whether an interpreter is needed), and to what extent services for Indigenous peoples exist in any given city (Environics Institute, 2010; Fast, 2014; Montgomery, 2003). Some cities have a greater proportion of Indigenous peoples who are first generation, and therefore, so-called &ldquo;culturally safe&rdquo; and appropriate services may still be developing. For example, in a report exploring the need for culturally-specific resources for Nisga&rsquo;a living away from their ancestral lands, Montgomery (2003) traced the development of the Native Friendship Centre movement and commented on some of the potential pitfalls of such a culturally diverse model of service provision for urban Indigenous peoples. He wrote that in 1972, the Canadian government officially recognized the long-term sustainability of Native Friendship Centres and implemented the Native
                            <a href="#" id="page-295" class="ch-link"></a>Migrating Peoples Program. An early evaluation of the Friendship Centres found that they had established a wide base of support among community members and were able to apply their funds creatively (Montgomery, 2003). However, despite the support received for the Centres, Montgomery asserted that due to the &ldquo;liberal cultural pluralist&rdquo; model employed by Friendship Centres, other local organizations may feel that they do not need to offer culturally relevant services to urban Indigenous peoples. Furthermore, certain cultural traditions tend to be favoured over others, in all likelihood based on the majority Indigenous culture(s) represented in a specific city. Thus, the relevance of some of the cultural programming or resources may be limited for Indigenous peoples who do not identify with those cultures.</p>

                        <p>The issue of cultural identity is important for all Indigenous peoples, but it may be further complicated when Indigenous individuals live in an urban environment. Early academic discourses on urban Indigenous peoples beginning in the 1940s and 1950s that coincided with increased migration to cities centered on the notion that urban life was incompatible with Indigenous cultures and identities. Migration to cities was seen as a decision to abandon Indigenous identities and assimilate into the mainstream culture. In contrast, a 2011 paper argued that emerging research has found that urban living is not at odds with a retention or emergence of positive Indigenous identities and communities (Peters, 1996, 2011).</p>
                        <p>Peters (2011) identified four main themes that impact urban Indigenous identities: (1) settler racism, (2) municipal settler colonialism, (3) the onus to search out opportunities to remain culturally connected ,and, (4) the cultural heterogeneity of cities.</p>
                        <p>Settler racism was defined as both blatant and more subtle forms of discrimination, where white privilege and ways of life were naturalized. For example, Indigenous healing practices were not even considered as options in mainstream health care.</p>
                        <p>Municipal settler colonialism was seen as a second, related theme in the emerging research on urban Indigenous identities . For example, Newhouse and Peters (2001) argued that research on urban Indigenous peoples often focuses on individuals and neglects the larger urban Indigenous community. Some legislation requires social workers to involve an Indigenous child&rsquo;s community in all decisions concerning placement of children (Sinha et al., 2011). Social workers may need to think more broadly about who makes up someone&rsquo;s community in an urban setting, especially if they have lived in the city for several generations, and they should always ask the family to determine who makes up their own community and support system.</p>
                        <p>The third theme that Peters found in the literature on urban Indigenous identities was the challenge of having to consciously decide to seek out opportunities to be involved in cultural activities or to be part of an urban community (Frideres, 2008; Lawrence, 2004). This might speak to the assumption that urban Indigenous persons have frequent access to the land or their home communities, when for many, this is neither a financial or logistical reality, especially if family members have been living in the city for several generations (Howard and Proulx, 2011).</p>
                        <p>The fourth emergent theme in the academic literature on urban Indigenous peoples is the cultural heterogeneity of cities. Tensions between providing culturally specific programs or opportunities and providing spaces where all Indigenous peoples are welcome are sometimes amplified by limited resources (Frideres, 2008; Proulx, 2003). Social workers must keep this in mind when working with Indigenous families.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-296" class="ch-link"></a>Two factors make it difficult to formulate a comprehensive Indigenous approach to practice. First, the Indigenous peoples of Canada are exceedingly diverse, with many languages, cultures, and traditions, and Indigenous peoples have a variety of healing and helping philosophies and techniques. Second, a legacy of mistrust and animosity exists toward those in the helping professions, including social work. An Indigenous approach to social work needs to be flexible enough to incorporate a variety of healing methods and must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. It is imperative that the approach is based on the wants of Indigenous peoples and that it gives power to Indigenous communities. Also, social workers must try to find interpreters that speak the same dialect as their clients, and respect a client’s right to be served by either Indigenous or non-Indigenous service providers.</p>
                                            <p>An Indigenous approach to social work does not mean that mainstream methods are of no value. Located in St. Albert, Alberta, the Nechi Institute: Centre of Indigenous Learning is a good example of a training organization that incorporates both traditional Indigenous and mainstream standards. Its holistic approach is based on the belief that true physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual healing occurs when an individual is in harmony with his or her environment. It also contends that problems must be understood within the context of history, community setting, personal experience, culture, and the social institutions that have had an influence on the individual.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Four Key Principles</p>
                                            <p>The development of an Indigenous approach to social work practice should be consistent with four key principles:</p>
                                            <ul class="ul--list">
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item">the recognition of a distinct Indigenous world view</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item">the development of consciousness regarding the destructive impact of colonialism on Indigenous peoples</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item">an emphasis on the importance of cultural knowledge and traditions</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item">the application of the concept of Indigenous empowerment</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>These principles need to be practised alongside adherence to a holistic approach, a belief in equity, Aboriginal self-control, and a respect for diversity (Morrissette et al., 1993: 91).</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Recognizing a Distinct Indigenous World View</p>
                                            <p>The first principle acknowledges the existence of a distinct Indigenous world view. The First Nations (as well as the Inuit and Métis) of Canada have a particular approach to healing and helping. While Indigenous peoples do not have one single philosophy, there are fundamental differences between non-Indigenous and Indigenous world views. For example, the concept of the circle captured in the Medicine Wheel illustrates the notion of balance prevalent in Indigenous societies, in contrast to the typically linear models of cause and effect common in Western societies.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Understanding the Impact of Colonialism</p>
                                            <p>The second principle involves an analysis of the impact of colonization on Indigenous peoples. Colonizers attempted to subordinate Indigenous peoples and displace traditional spirituality, governance systems, leadership, and knowledge by means of missionaries, residential schools, child welfare, and artificial legal distinctions as set forth in the Indian Act
                                                <. A recognition and analysis of colonialism can assist social workers in framing problems, in recognizing solutions that emphasize self-determination, and in seeing the importance of the reclamation of Indigenous cultures and identities in the social work process.</p>
                                                    <p>Even today, social work with Indigenous families is sometimes premised on the Western perception that individuals are members of nuclear families, and that individuals can turn to specialized institutions for problem-specific help. This is not consistent with an Indiegnous perspective. Indigenous peoples often perceive themselves to be members of a family network in which everyone is obliged to contribute resources and support to all community members. The discrepancy between Indigenous ways of helping and conventional social work is even more pronounced when the worker is an outsider. Conventional methods, in which community members turn to outside agencies for help, weaken internal bonds of mutual aid. Indigenous communities might begin to question their ability to help one another as they are unable to contribute to the external social work process that becomes the community’s source of help. This fosters dependency and weakens the traditional community bonds of mutual aid.</p>
                                                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Cultural Knowledge and Traditions</p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        <a href="#" id="page-297" class="ch-link"></a>The third principle of reclaiming Indigenous culture emphasizes an awareness of and reflection on common aspects of culture and identity. By examining Indigenous history, culture, and traditions and dispelling the conventional views of Indigenous reality flowing from colonialism, Indigenous peoples can begin to see the underlying causes of their individual problems. There are differences in the extent to which individuals identify with traditional Indigenous culture and therefore in how much the reclamation of Indigenous culture will assist in social work intervention. Some will adhere to the teachings of Elders and follow traditional ways, while others may not.</p>
                                                    <p>Indigenous peoples today are healing from the ravages wreaked upon them by residential schools and the child welfare system, and from the results of the systemic racism and discrimination within Canadian society. They are in the process of redefining themselves in the context of their traditional cultural practices. Traditionally, Indigenous peoples have used some form of the “healing circle” to underpin their approach to healing. The circle captures the important notion that we are all one and that the entire universe is connected.</p>
                                                    <p>In many cases, traditional healing techniques and teachings are combined with mainstream methods at healing lodges in Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Québec, where the power of Aboriginal spirituality and traditional teachings are combined with crisis intervention techniques. Holistic healing is the healing of the mind, body, emotions, and spirit. Traditionally, this is done through sweat lodges, fasts, vision quests, herbal medicines, ceremonial healing with the eagle fan and rattles (in which sacred songs and the drum are key components), traditional teachings at the sacred fire, sharing circles, and individualized counselling.</p>
                                                    <p>Operated by Corrections Services Canada, the Waseskun Healing Centre located about an hour from Montréal, Québec works closely with different indigenous communities from across Canada, including the northern regions. It offers French and English holistic teachings. These teachings focus on an Indigenous offender’s physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health, to help them regain balance in their lives. Waseskun’s overall aim is to empower residents to accept responsibility for their own actions and understand the consequences they have created for themselves, the people they have hurt, their families, and their communities.</p>
                                                    <p>Programs follow a community-based and holistic healing philosophy that incorporates both Western and traditional therapeutic approaches. The Centre strongly encourages Indigenous communities to participate in the healing journey and reintegration of their members.</p>
                                                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Principle of Empowerment</p>
                                                    <p>In the context of social work practice, the principle of Indigenous empowerment emphasizes the participation of community members in bringing about lasting social change. For example, the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC), a not-for-profit aggregate of thirteen Native women’s organizations, was founded in 1974 with the collective goal to enhance, promote, and foster the social, economic, cultural, and political well-being of First Nations and Métis women within First Nations, Métis, and Canadian societies.</p>
                                                    <p>In the 1990s, when a substance use problem among young people arose within Innu communities in Labrador, leaders asked for help and the federal government spent millions of dollars to try to resolve issues in a Western way—but it didn’t work. The tragedy of the Innu Nation of Labrador illustrates how important empowerment is to community healing. Chief Simeon Tshakapesh stressed the need to involve Innu members in finding long-term solutions to the problems of substance use and suicide among their children. He criticized the federal and Newfoundland governments for imposing unsuccessful programs on his community in the past: “We are here today because the solutions didn’t work. We will never allow others to control our future.”</p>
                                                    <p>At its most basic level, the principle of empowerment implies that services must be defined and shaped by those seeking help—and not controlled exclusively by service providers.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-298" class="ch-link">In urban areas of Canada, a range</a> of medical and mental health services are provided to Aboriginal children, youth, adults, and seniors through universal healthcare programs provided by the provinces. In northern parts of Canada and on-reserve, medical services are funded by Health Canada, although the range of services varies from community to community, depending on remoteness and population. Rarely are health-care services provided in ways that are sensitive to Aboriginal cultures, languages, and ways of healing. And substandard services (e.g, starvation diets in residential schools, boil-water advisories lasting for decades, and other measures to minimize costs) have been well documented.</p>
                        <p>Aboriginal ways of healing typically follow more holistic methods of restoring wellness to individuals whose physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual health is out of balance. Aboriginal healing aligns with Aboriginal world views, Indigenous knowledge, and traditional roles that have enabled Aboriginal peoples to survive and thrive in their homelands for millennia.</p>
                        <p>Traditional Aboriginal peoples understand themselves as individual human beings who are connected to the other life forces that share and shape the lands where they reside. Many Aboriginal peoples understand that protocols for fostering good relations&mdash;and good health&mdash;are found within the teachings of Indigenous knowledge. Arising from traditional protocols, it is not uncommon for Aboriginal peoples to use some form of &ldquo;healing circle&rdquo; to underpin their approach to healing. The circle captures the important notion, often forgotten, that all life forces are one and that everything within the entire universe is connected.</p>
                        <p>Some Aboriginal cultural traditions conceptualize a healing circle in terms of the four sacred directions of North, South, East, and West. The circle and the four sacred directions are symbols of holistic healing that embody the four elements of whole health:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Spiritual health, including gaining traditional knowledge and exploring the spiritual heritage of human beings in ways that may involve participating in prayer, rituals, and ceremonies</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Mental health, including engaging in formal and informal education processes, gaining knowledge of Aboriginal history and cultural contributions, being able to enact cultural roles, and having meaningful opportunities to demonstrate activities that promote self-determination</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Physical health, including taking steps to keep communities and loved ones safe, understanding the connection between what is ingested and the ability to undertake important functions, and participating in sports-related, recreational, and cultural activities</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Historic Aboriginal social systems that kept communities safe, cared for citizens, and educated children have been rediscovered and reclaimed. Aboriginal ways of healing that cannot be verified by Western scientific methods are also being reclaimed, as the story on spiritual healing illustrates.</p>

                            <p>Many Aboriginal world views do not typically differentiate between energy forces found within the natural world in the same way as mainstream science does; in many cultural teachings, things are either animated with energy or they are not. The flowing currents of tides, winds, and weather patterns hold dynamic power, and because this same energy is contained within plants, it is that power that nourishes us. When we ingest food in the form of grains, roots, or meat, inhale air and the smoke of medicinal plants, and drink water and herbal infusions, the Earth&rsquo;s energy becomes manifest within our bodies and we can be well. Indigenous teachings call upon us to respect this power and uphold the relationships among living things. When we enter into respectful relationships with other beings in our environments&mdash;people we know and animals we share our lives with&mdash;our spirits and emotions become healthy. Within Western therapeutic methods, the healing power of human-animal interactions has been classified as animal-assisted interventions (Bachi et al., 2012).</p>
                            <p>One example of the healing power of relationships between human beings and animals can be found in the relationship between some Aboriginal peoples and horses. Horses represent strength, freedom, and an indomitable spirit that cannot be broken. When treated with respect, horses share their gifts with the human beings who seek relationships with them. So strong is this bond that some Aboriginal groups developed unique cultural ceremonies involving horses (e.g., the horse dance and the horse giveaway) as a means of respecting the mutually beneficial relationship that can develop when humans take care of horses, and horses take care of people.</p>
                            <p>Although the healing power of human-horse relationships has long been recognized among Aboriginal peoples, the phenomenon of equine-assisted learning has only relatively recently received attention from academic researchers. In 2013, a team of researchers from the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina, and the University of Calgary produced a study entitled &ldquo;The Helping Horse: How Equine-Assisted Learning Contributes to the Well-being of First Nations Youth in Treatment for Volatile Substance Abuse&rdquo; (Adams et al., 2015). This study involved a partnership between the White Buffalo Treatment Centre and the Cartier Equine Learning Centre located north of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.</p>
                            <p>Girls from across the country, ranging between 12 and 17 years of age, come to the White Buffalo Treatment Centre because they have been sniffing solvents. They struggle with issues of identity, belonging, and acceptance. &ldquo;They come to us with certain behaviour and learning challenges,&rdquo; said Ernest Sauve, executive director of the Centre.</p>
                            <p>A component of their healing journey is working with horses at the Cartier Equine Learning Centre. &ldquo;The horses provide a real calming effect on the youth,&rdquo; added Sauve. Youth develop healthier relationships with people simply because they have learned to lead and respect the horse. &ldquo;They have a lot of anger, resentment, and hostility toward themselves, others, and authoritative figures,&rdquo; said Sauve. &ldquo;But that changes when they start working with a horse.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Principle investigator Colleen Dell, of the University of Saskatchewan, said the horse also helps make youth feel comfortable. &ldquo;If you and a human go into counseling there will always be a barrier because it is human to human. With the horse that is gone because there is no verbal communication, which is often a barrier,&rdquo; she noted. &ldquo;A child who has been physically abused only knows unhealthy touch, but a horse can teach you what healthy touching is. A counsellor can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she added.</p>
                            <p>Dell said it&rsquo;s also important to recognize the significance of the horse in some First Nations cultures. Incorporating traditional teachings about the horse, she said, will help the teenage girls in their healing. &ldquo;There is an exchange of spirits,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The youth say they just want to be with the horse.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The research team, in consultation with Elders, organized a ceremonial horse dance to commemorate and bless the beginning of the study. &ldquo;It gave the program the direction it needed. We honour the spirit of the horse and we honoured the girls in their healing.&rdquo; (Grebinski, 2010).</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-300" class="ch-link text--bold">As described previously in this book,</a> social work and Indigenous peoples in Canada have had a long and tumultuous history. Deconstruction of Western pedagogies that have driven practice, and acknowledgement that oppression still exists, are vital to the formation of alliances between the social work profession and Indigenous peoples (Tamburro, 2013).</p>
                        <p>Mental health and substance use issues continue to cause harm to Indigenous populations, and they cannot be addressed from a purely Westernized social work perspective.Historically, the lack of traditional Indigenous practices in mainstream social work has meant that the experiences of Indigenous clients have been neglected. Just as our understanding of mental health and substance use disorders has changed and grown, so too must our understanding of these issues change and grow within an Indigenous cultural context. Social work traces its origins back to Euro-Western beliefs about alleviating social issues within societies. A more flexible, integrative framework will allow the inclusion of practices deriving from non-social work frameworks. Integrating traditional beliefs and customs into social work practice can better address the challenges faced by Indigenous clients. Social work education must reflect a commitment to this evolving framework. By drawing from the perspectives of Elders, teachers, and community members, social work educators can incorporate a revised understanding of the oppression of Indigenous peoples into their everyday practice (Sinclair, 2004).</p>
                        <p>The experiences of Indigenous individuals living in urban settings often reveal frequent misconceptions, assumptions, discrimination, and racist attitudes directed toward them . The Urban Aboriginal Peoples Study (Environics Institute, 2010) found that 70 percent of Indigenous people living in urban centres felt negatively portrayed by non-Indigenous people. Assumptions on the part of social workers that are fueled by historical racist connotations invalidate the voices and experiences of clients, much to the detriment of their mental health and overall social and personal well-being. Assumptive beliefs&mdash;about Indigenous history, culture, and current challenges faced by Indigenous peoples&mdash;that are held by social workers and Canadian society at large can impede the recovery of Indigenous clients.</p>
                        <p>Despite the existence of Indigenous services in urban settings, interaction with non-Indigenous service providers is often unavoidable. Social work practitioners and educators have a responsibility to work with Indigenous communities to challenge colonial pedagogy within Canadian society as well as within day-to-day social work practice.</p>
                        <p>Storytelling is an especially effective media included in traditional practices, as determined by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers (Davis, 2014). Storytelling can lead to a deeper understanding of a client&rsquo;s own experiences, a dispelling of Westernized notions of barriers confronting indigenous clients, and a rejection of pervasive racist ideologies. Storytelling enhances understanding of past experiences of oppression within a present-day context to help gain helpful insights into current challenges. In Theresa and Sarah&rsquo;s story, a young woman gives voice to the painful aftermath of displacement from a rural to an urban setting by framing her experiences in the form of a personal narrative.</p>

                                <a href="#" id="page-301" class="ch-link"></a>Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous practitioners who work with Indigenous individuals and families living in an urban environment must respectfully refrain from making prior assumptions about their clients&rsquo; histories and lifestyles.</p>
                            <p>Theresa is a 52-year-old Indigenous woman who lives in Toronto, having moved there from a reserve in northwestern Ontario. Theresa has a 16-year-old son and a 21-year-old daughter who both reside with her. Theresa&rsquo;s 21-year-old daughter, Sarah, is living with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder type I and has struggled with alcohol dependency since adolescence. Sarah has an 18-month-old son, Jonah. Over the past several weeks, Theresa has become worried about Jonah&rsquo;s well-being and has called Native Child and Family Services of Toronto for assistance. The case worker appointed to the family encourages Sarah to seek mental health counselling. Sarah consents to this plan and the case worker sets up an appointment for Sarah with a social worker who will help determine which services Sarah might need.</p>
                            <p>Sarah&rsquo;s initial meeting with the social worker, Leah, does not go well. At one point, Leah makes unfavourable assumptive remarks about Sarah&rsquo;s family history. Leah alludes to the probability that Sarah had an abusive home life, a family history of alcohol misuse, and drug use within her home. Upon hearing these presumptuous and erroneous remarks, Sarah becomes upset and attempts to explain that her problematic behaviours do not originate from within her family, but rather, were encouraged by her peers. At the same time, Sarah&rsquo;s bipolar disorder symptoms were becoming worse. Leah is not fully convinced of this explanation, however, and persists with her line of questioning into Sarah&rsquo;s presumed family pathology. Sarah becomes angry and abruptly leaves the session, believing that her experiences and feelings of vulnerability have been invalidated.</p>
                            <p>Theresa learns about this incident from Sarah and encourages her to meet with a different worker. Sarah finally agrees to do so on the condition that Theresa attend the intake session with her. Theresa and Sarah meet with a new social worker, Derrick, who begins the session by explaining that he wishes to establish a mutual contractual agreement based on client-centered practice. Derrick and Sarah agree that discussions revolving around Sarah&rsquo;s mental health and substance use are to be the prime focus of Sarah&rsquo;s sessions with Derrick&mdash;and not Sarah&rsquo;s family history.</p>
                            <p>Derrick begins by asking Sarah to tell him about the current challenges she is facing in her relationships with family, friends, and others in her community. Sarah explains that her issues related to alcohol started within her social circle and not within her family. After moving to Toronto, Sarah began to drink to battle her bipolar symptoms, her feelings of alienation, and the racism she had experienced at school. She explained to Derrick that in the past, counsellors had made invaid assumptions about her substance use&mdash;but she is adamant that her dependency issues are not related to her First Nations heritage.</p>
                            <p>Derrick encourages Sarah to verbalize a narrative of her experiences with mental health challenges and substance use. He explains that her story does not need to follow a linear progression but rather can involve a recounting of her most difficult struggles and how she had managed at times to stabilize herself in ways that were empowering. Sarah narrates her experiences from her own perspective, looking to Theresa for verification of events, dates, and places about which her memory is somewhat unclear. As Sarah tells her story, Derrick engages only to acknowledge and validate Sarah&rsquo;s narrative. Through storytelling, Theresa portrays for Derrick the stresses endured by the whole family after moving to Toronto. Separation from their family, friends, and community while attempting to adjust to life in a large city had proved challenging for everyone.</p>
                            <p>Since moving to Toronto, the family has felt stigmatized by expressions of assumptive beliefs about First Nations people. Derrick encourages both women to continue to attend counselling sessions together and to feel confident in voicing their own story, rather than having it told to them by others. Derrick recommends various support groups for First Nations families living in the city, and provides a referral to these programs for both Sarah and Theresa. Both women agree to return for further counselling, having been reassured that Derrick will formulate no prior assumptions about them based on stereotypes.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" id="page-302" class="ch-link">Respectful social work practice </a>in northern regions begins with an appreciation for a community&rsquo;s members; their ways of life, culture, beliefs, and values; and the land that sustains them. While some social work positions in these regions are rotational&mdash;involving travel in and out of the community&mdash;most Indigenous communities prefer workers to live in, engage with, and become part of the community. Demonstrating a genuine commitment to and respect for the community is central to gaining trust, building relationships, and providing meaningful services.</p>
                        <p>Many northern communities are small, isolated, and accessible only by long, rough roads, snowmobiles, boats, and/or small planes. This isolation promotes a feeling of community closeness and self-reliance that is not found in large urban centres. For a social worker, however, it can lead to a blurring of personal and professional boundaries: your clients are also your store clerks, neighbours, colleagues, and witnesses to&mdash;or even part of&mdash;your social life. Furthermore, clients often have interpersonal relationships with each other&mdash;both positive and negative&mdash;and the social worker may be providing confidential, individual services to more than one member of a social group or may become privy to information about a client by way of gossip, word of mouth, or social media. Finally, social service networks in northern communities are smaller, requiring outside-the-box thinking, flexibility, and collaboration on the part of service providers.</p>
                        <p>Indigenous communities in northern regions are struggling to achieve holistic wellness in a context of unmet basic needs and current and historic traumas. Approaches to addressing this challenge are multi-faceted and unique to each community. They include political processes for self-government and Indigenous-controlled services; recreational and wellness activities, including sports, sewing, drumming, and singing; and advocacy for the development of infrastructure and employment opportunities. Approaches also include community-building events, such as feasts and celebrations, as well as cultural and land-based programs that include sweat lodges, land-based treatment centres, and hunting/fishing/gathering mentorship activities. Finally, intervention services include counselling, family welfare services, and therapeutic groups, such as support groups and healing circles&mdash;all involving many people, from youth to Elders.</p>
                        <p>Many communities express a desire for partnerships in their efforts to achieve change; they do not want outsiders to &ldquo;come and fix things for them,&rdquo; but rather to work alongside them, sharing knowledge, resources, and power in action. To become such partners, social workers entering northern communities can begin by engaging with community leaders, such as Elders, local service providers, the Chief, and the band council to learn about the strengths and needs of the community, its activities, services, and programs, and leaders&rsquo; perceptions of your role. A genuine openness to understanding the perspectives of others, from the outset, is critical to providing meaningful services. Social workers from outside a community must be open to collaborating in the processes of Indigenous empowerment for culturally congruent services and programming.</p>
                        <p>Programming and services evolve with changing personnel and community needs. Thus, keeping up to date can facilitate appropriate connections for clients. Sustained communication also enables the pooling of resources for optimal programming, such as inter-agency committees and action groups. Programming might include Community Freezer services, youth land-based programs, and detailed case planning for vulnerable individuals. As Mark&rsquo;s story shows, clients are often willing to grant consent for social workers to engage with other services on their behalf.</p>

                                <a href="#" id="page-303" class="ch-link text--bold">Mark, aged 17, is from a small Indigenous community</a> in northern Canada that is accessible only by plane. At the age of eight, Mark was removed from his parents&rsquo; care due to domestic violence and neglect, compounded by alcohol misuse. He now wishes to live with his parents again.</p>
                            <p>As there were no foster homes in his community, Mark was placed with a foster family in another town. For the next eight years, he lived in five foster homes in three different communities. Due to high airfares, he saw his parents only once or twice a year. At the age of 16, Mark was legally entitled to terminate child protection services, which he did, and he decided to return to live with his parents. Adjustment to living at home has proved challenging for Mark: his parents are drinking heavily and getting into fights; the only family income is biweekly social assistance payments, often spent on alcohol; and there is rarely food in the home. Nor is there telephone, television, or Internet.</p>
                            <p>Consistent with Mark&rsquo;s cultural values, his extended family and friends help when they can, but they are struggling themselves. His paternal grandmother provides a home for her daughter and grandchildren and financial support to other family members. Mark often has meals at her house, but since she has only three bedrooms shared by seven people, he spends the night at his friends&rsquo; houses when his parents are drinking and fighting.</p>
                            <p>Despite his chaotic home life, Mark usually attends school. He uses marijuana occasionally and smokes cigarettes once in a while, but he has sworn never to drink. Up until last week, he was dating a girl named Alice who was a major support to him. Today, however, Mark finds out that Alice is dating someone new. Distressed by this loss, upset with his parents&rsquo; continued drinking, and feeling rejected for not having made the school hockey team, Mark posted on Facebook, &ldquo;everythings wrong lifes not worth it.&rdquo; His aunt saw the posting and called the local health clinic, believing Mark to be suicidal. The RCMP brought Mark into the local health clinic for a suicide assessment.</p>
                            <p>Jane has lived and worked in the community for a year as one of two mental health social workers at the health clinic. She provides services ranging from crisis intervention to one-on-one counselling to coordinating Elder circles. When Jane meets Mark, she notices his dejected affect, monosyllabic responses, and air of hopelessness and helplessness. Seeking positives, she learns that his closest friends are James and Alex and that his favourite teacher is Mr. Collins. Mark tells Jane that he really likes playing hockey, going hunting, and playing with his younger cousins. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t make the hockey team and he doesn&rsquo;t get to go hunting because his family cannot afford it.</p>
                            <p>Jane starts thinking about supports available to Mark in his community. These include his family and friends, a community youth support group, youth camping trips that feature cultural activities, outreach services for youth, a youth cooking program, and youth recreational activities. Jane suggests that she and Mark create a plan together, first to help Mark recover a sense of hope and then to address his immediate safety concerns.</p>
                            <p>After a discussion with Mark, Jane telephones an Indigenous youth worker, who invites Mark to participate in the upcoming youth camping and hunting trip and regular sports nights. Mark agrees to attend if his friends will go, and the youth worker offers to help Mark train for sports teams. Mark also learns that there is a Community Freezer where he can get basic food supplies such as pasta, canned milk, or fish and game. Having a plan to address some basic survival needs helps reduce Mark&rsquo;s anxiety level, and he and Jane then begin to develop an immediate safety plan.</p>
                            <p>With Mark&rsquo;s consent, Jane invites his grandmother and his aunt to join the discussion. Because his parents are drinking, he will stay with his friend James that night and James&rsquo;s mom will be told of the suicide concerns. The need for a consistent place to stay when his parents are drinking will be discussed at the next appointment. The people Mark identifies as being important supports to him will be invited to this appointment.</p>
                            <p>Mark&rsquo;s mood improves steadily during the appointment. He has a safe place to stay that night and a follow-up appointment booked for the next day. Jane concludes that Mark is no longer at immediate risk of suicide. To be on the safe side, she checks in with her manager (who is based in a larger city centre) and she consults with the clinic&rsquo;s nurse. James and his mom come to take Mark to their home, and Mark seems much calmer.</p>

                            <p>
                                <a href="#" id="page-304" class="ch-link"></a>I am Executive Director for the Wabaseemoong Child Welfare Authority. The province of Ontario mandated <a href="http://www.aafs.ca/">Anishinaabe Abinoojii Family Services (AAFS)</a> and we, in turn, work with AAFS. This arrangement is really a transfer of responsibility back to the community. It is the community that will build its own resources and then transfer that responsibility back to the kids, the parents, and the families. I think this transfer of responsibility brings back to the members of the community the dignity that they&rsquo;ve lost [as a result of colonialism, the residential school system, and other past injustices].</p>
                            <p>For a long time, my goal as a social worker was always &ldquo;helping, helping, helping&rdquo; and I forgot that people are not just clients, but that they have responsibilities as well as rights. I learned from my grandkids, by just watching them. When I tried to help them, one of them said, &ldquo;No, I have to learn!&rdquo; and I knew he was right. He always found his own way. I thought that his self-sufficiency was great and I started using that example in my work. I knew that people had their own inner strengths and that they had to experience change from within.</p>
                            <p>So that&rsquo;s the kind of approach I&rsquo;m taking now. I&rsquo;m just trying to facilitate. All of our messes come from what I would call prescribed ways of thinking and doing : &ldquo;This is how you do it, this is how you help,&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m finding that we follow our processes and it justifies our actions&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t really build that person or family up. And that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d like to go.</p>
                            <p>In my present work, I&rsquo;m doing things in ways that differ from mainstream approaches. We&rsquo;re creating a history book of what it was like before things changed in the community and what happened with the flooding, the mercury, the residential schools, the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, what was impacted, and who was impacted.</p>
                            <p>We&rsquo;re finding out that there is a layered effect to the experience of trauma, harm, and injustice. The community members who were affected immediately by trauma understand where their frustrations, resentments, hatred, and anger come from. We&rsquo;re now probably into the fifth or sixth generation of people who have experienced the same unsettling feelings but don&rsquo;t understand why. They don&rsquo;t realize that there was a system before this system came in, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to revive&mdash;the old system that was based on responsibility.</p>
                            <p>When the Anishinaabe were hunting, there was no competition to see who the best hunter was. What they did was show each other how to become better because each of them relied on one another to feed the community, and each of them had to be as good as they could be. They all supported one another to help each other improve. Their goal was to make each other develop more fully, but it was not for themselves&mdash;it was so that others in the community could benefit. I can see something similar when my grandkids take their friends out into the wilderness with them instead of keeping it to themselves.</p>
                            <p>We had a conference a few days ago. A young man spoke and said, &ldquo;I really want to go out and relearn all the things that our ancestors had, to go out in a canoe, to have an Elder tell me how to set up camp and what to look for, how to paddle properly, how to look after a fire.&rdquo; He told us, &ldquo;I was diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and it&rsquo;s not my fault. But I don&rsquo;t want to be a victim or think of myself as a victim.&rdquo; So some things are getting better, and I think it&rsquo;s partly through young people reclaiming their Indigenous identity.</p>
                            <p>When I hear my grandkids pick up on an idea and get excited or hear about an idea and disagree with it, there&rsquo;s no holding them back. It&rsquo;s so free and so natural. I think that our younger people will carry that openness, that asking, that wanting to learn forward. It is a life-affirming process.</p>
                            <p>You have to go back into the past and you have to understand what happened, especially to yourself, as well what happened to our people. You need to understand what has happened to bring about changes, but also how to go back. The spirits are waiting and all the tools that are out there are waiting.</p>
                            <p>I was told, &ldquo;You have such a pipe dream. It&rsquo;s so way out there. You&rsquo;re going to give up.&rdquo; That was back in the 1980s when I was talking about reviving our own laws. Now it&rsquo;s 2015 and we&rsquo;re almost there. We&rsquo;ve moved toward people talking about reclaiming our laws and actually little bits at a time are bringing them back. My pipe dream is everybody else&rsquo;s pipe dream now.</p>

                        <li>Visit <a href="http://beststart.org/">beststart.org</a>, the Best Start Resource Centre website, and read the 2012 report titled “Why Am I Poor? First Nations Child Poverty in Ontario.” In a two-page summary, describe the main contributing factors to First Nations child poverty in Canada’s largest province as well as the report’s key recommendations for the eradication of child poverty in First Nations communities.</li>
                        <li>The federal government formed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as part of IRSSA. Research the mandate and scope of the TRC and present your results in a three-page paper.</li>
                        <li>On September 13, 2007, the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Declaration establishes a universal framework of minimum standards, but Canada was one of four nations to reject it at the time. On November 12, 2010, the government of Canada finally formally endorsed the Declaration. However, some observers felt that the government’s official statement fell short of actual endorsement. Beginning with the Assembly of First Nations website (<a href="afn.ca"></a>), research this issue and write a two-page paper summarizing your research&#160;findings.</li>
