                <p>Following World War II, social welfare expanded in the industrialized societies of the west, and so did the social work profession itself. The expectation was that the state would ensure the economic and social security of its citizens. During the last quarter of the last century, however, there was a shift toward more selective coverage, accompanied by funding cutbacks by successive federal and provincial governments. The result was greater stress for clients and larger caseloads for social workers. </p>
                <p> Today is a challenging but exciting time to be a social worker: there is a pressing need to campaign for restored funding for social services so that all human necessities can be met. At the same time, innovative practice models that work for clients are required. Social workers are valued now more than ever before; it is a good time to enter the profession.</p>

                    <p>In the nineteenth century, public assistance in English Canada largely followed England’s example. In the face of the massive social disruption that had been caused by rapid industrialization, early English legislation required local parishes to provide relief to poor people if they were elderly, ill, or disabled.</p>
                    <p>The parishes were organized by the Church of England. Each had a local council that was responsible for assisting the poor, or providing “poor relief.” The Poor Law of 1601</span> and its reform in 1832 carefully distinguished between two types of relief: one for the elderly and sick, who could receive relief in almshouses or poorhouses, and one for the able-bodied poor, who were made to labour in workhouses in exchange for relief. The purpose of the latter type of aid was to make the seeking of such public assistance shameful and demeaning.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Deserving and Undeserving Poor</p>
                    <p>Following a request for assistance, a charity visitor would be designated to interview the applicant in his or her home. The visitors were volunteers, generally men and women from the upper classes or people from the ranks of the emerging professional and business classes. While the work required experience and skill, proposals to hire full-time, paid visitors met with resistance from people in positions of power.</p>
                    <p>A visitor’s first task was to classify the applicant as either “deserving” or “undeserving” poor.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-1">Deserving poor. </span>People designated as deserving poor were seen as being of good moral character and only temporarily out of luck through no fault of their own. The deserving poor did not ask directly for help, and were clean and tidy.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span-keyword text--red">Undeserving poor. </span>The undeserving poor were those individuals deemed to be lazy or morally degenerate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once an applicant was judged to be deserving, he or she had to appear before a committee of trustees, who made the final decision to grant aid. The board granted aid in only about half of the cases determined to be circumstances of destitution.</p>
                    <p>In Canada in the early nineteenth century, relief was provided primarily by private philanthropic societies. Organizations such as the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor of St. John’s (1808), the Society for Promoting Education and Industry among the Indians and Destitute Settlers in Canada (1827), the Kingston Benevolent Society (1821), the Halifax Poor Man’s Friend Society (1820), and the Montréal Ladies’ Benevolent Society (1832) were preoccupied with the termination of begging and the value of labour. Relief, rarely provided as cash but rather in the form of food or other necessities, was usually given in return for work. These same organizations, however, resisted the introduction of more scientific methods of charity that were advocated from the 1830s onwards (Rooke and Schnell, 1983: 46–56). (The topic of “scientific philanthropy” will be discussed later in this chapter.)</p>
                    <p>The relief provided by the volunteers of numerous charities and church parishes was soon deemed disorganized and inefficient, as there was very little regulation or coordination. Toronto alone had 43 different nns by 1894. Over time, these agencies developed training programs for their volunteers, which formed the basis for the University of Toronto’s Social Services Program, established in 1914.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">In the nineteenth century, even children were forced to work in factories and on farms for relief from poverty. For many families, it was more important for a child to bring home a wage than to get an education. Dangerous working conditions and long hours meant that children worked as hard as adults, but no laws existed to protect them.</p>
                            <p class="text--caption">Children were less expensive to employ than adults, and they were easier to discipline. In rural areas, children as young as five worked in “agricultural gangs.” In 1821, approximately 49 percent of Britain’s workforce was under the age of 20. The <span class="CharOverride-2">Factory Act</span> of 1833 made it illegal for textile factories to employ children under 9 years of age. </p>
                            <p class="text--caption">Government regulations eventually limited the number of hours in a day children worked in factories, but employers were not necessarily liable for accidents until 1937.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-38" class="ch-link">The Charity Organisation Society</a></p>
                    <p>In 1869, proponents of better organization for charitable assistance in England formed the London-based<span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-2"> Charity Organisation Society (COS)</span> to coordinate the efforts of the various charities. The COS brought order to the chaos created by the activities of 640 charitable institutions. The voluntary work conducted under the auspices of the COS was possibly the most widespread attempt to help the poor. Workers in this organization were expected to cooperate with other charities and with the agents of the Poor Law.</p>
                    <p>The COS believed that indiscriminate material relief would cause pauperism: it could lure a person from thrift and hard work into a life of dependency and reliance on handouts. The COS believed that the charity visitors could serve as models of the value of hard work and thrift.</p>
                    <p>However, these visitors encountered many difficulties and soon sought out specific training and “scientific methods” to cope with them. As these visitors became more familiar with standardized techniques of providing assistance, they began practising what came to be called social “casework” (Copp, 1974: 108–120).</p>
                    <p>The popularity of the COS stemmed partly from the relief it accorded to local taxpayers; money could be saved if private charities used unpaid volunteers and members of religious orders (Blyth, 1972: 21). The COS was renamed the Family Welfare Association in 1946 and still operates in Britain today as Family Action, a registered family-support charity.</p>
                    <p>The Protestant Charity Organization Society arrived in Montréal in 1901, following an earlier effort to organize a charity in Toronto. It was primarily directed by businessmen and upper-class women who believed that poverty was the fault of the individual.</p>

                    <p>The aspect of social work concerned with community work has its roots in the <span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-3">settlement house movement</span>. The term derived from the notion of “settling in,” whereby relief workers would take up residence in the very neighbourhoods they were helping. The purpose of settlement houses was to bring the youth of the educated middle class and the charitable gentry to live among urban residents—a kind of mission to the poor. Canon Barnett, the founder of the movement in England, explained that the idea was “to bridge the gap that industrialism had created between rich and poor, to reduce the mutual suspicion and ignorance of one class for the other, and to do something more than give charity…. They would make their settlement an outpost of education and culture” (Davis, 1967: 6).The first settlement house was established in the east end of London in 1884. It was named Toynbee Hall, after Arnold Toynbee, an Oxford University historian who had settled in the same neighbourhood and had died in 1883.</p>
                    <p>From the 1880s through to the 1930s, the settlement house movement was a major factor in the emergence of social work. Jane Addams was the most prominent American to transport the idea of social settlements to the United States, founding Hull House in Chicago in 1889. William Lyon Mackenzie King, later to become prime minister of Canada, worked at Hull House in the 1890s, learning about the charitable work of Addams and others (Addams, 1961: viii; Ferns and Ostry, 1976: 37). Evangelia, the first settlement house in Toronto, was founded in 1902 by Libby Carson and Mary Bell with the support of the Toronto YWCA. Carson had founded several other settlement houses, including Christadora House in New York in 1897.</p>

In Montréal, the University Settlement House was established in 1909; and in Toronto, the University Settlement was founded in 1910, the Central Neighbourhood House in 1911, and the St. Christopher House in 1912. Most large Canadian cities had at least one settlement house by World War I. The first schools of social work in Canada were connected to, or often were started by, settlement workers (Davis, 1967: 3–25).</p>

                    <p>Social work occurs within a socio-political environment, and, therefore, understanding the historical context ensures an appreciation of the roots and progression of social work practice. The shifts and tensions within social welfare and social work practice in Canada have been influenced by historical developments in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>A renowned (now retired) social work professor at the University of British Columbia, Dennis T. Guest, provides a complete history of social welfare in Canada in his book, The Emergence of Social Security in Canada (3rd edition, 1997). This in-depth study offers shrewd insights into the nuts and bolts of social policy development in Canada. Relying heavily on Guest’s work, this chapter provides an overview of some critical junctures in the socio-political environment and the eventual consequences for Canadian social work practice.</p>
                    <p>Canada has its own unique history, in part reflecting the ideology of socialism, which combines the liberal ideology of maximizing individual freedom and liberty with the feudal or conservative values concerned with the group aspects of human life (Guest, 1997: 18). The ideological spectrum, as it is presented in Canadian history, is markedly different from that in the United States. The Canadian ideological spectrum “emphasizes the notion of equality of condition through cooperative, collective actions, displacing the liberal emphasis on equality of opportunity with its connotation of competitive struggle” (Guest, 1997: 18). The rest of this chapter explores major historical influences on the evolution of social work throughout the twentieth century and the early part of the twenty-first century.</p>
                    <p>World War I (1914-1918), in particular, produced profound changes in the social and economic structure of Canada. The federal government began to assume a role in moulding social and economic resources, by imposing, for example, a federal income tax on personal income. “The government became the sole support of hundreds of disabled soldiers, their wives and children, and the widows and orphans of the men killed in battle” (Guest, 1997: 49).</p>
                    <p>Increased attention to the plight of one-parent families, alongside lobbying by women’s organizations, led to the provision of Mothers’ Pensions. Initially residual in nature, this program eventually became a mother’s allowance program in all provinces. Programs such as this one foreshadowed public welfare programs, given their centralized administrative structures, specially trained staff, and funding supplied by provincial treasuries. These programs replaced the previous capricious discretionary power of local poor-relief administration (Guest, 1997: 64).</p>
                    <p>The first five decades of the twentieth century, however, continued to be influenced by values related to individualism; according to this ideology, poverty was seen as a result of personal failing or character weakness.

                    <p>As the twentieth century approached, urbanization and industrialization accelerated. Canadian political figure J.S. Woodsworth summed up this phenomenon: “Canada is leaving the country for the city.” Social reformers became increasingly appalled by the exploitation of children and the risks to safety in work sites that were often more like detention centres.</p>
                    <p>Public discourse began to focus on the relationship between government and its citizens, and public opinion underwent marked transformations. “The doctrines of laissez-faire and of individualism were being challenged by notions of social justice, by a concern for the well-being of the group and of the wider interests of the community as a whole” (Guest, 1997: 26).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Emergence of the Notion of a Social Minimum</p>
                    <p>Gradually, the notion of a <span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-4">social minimum </span>began to emerge. This viewpoint maintains that a political community should seek to ensure that its members can all enjoy at least a minimally decent standard of living. At the turn of the twentieth century, social reform became a multi-faceted public issue. Free public education and public libraries were established in larger Canadian cities and towns, and government entered into the field of public health, initially to combat outbreaks of cholera, smallpox, and typhoid. Work conditions were regulated.</p>
                    <p>In 1897, one of the first social survey research studies was carried out by H.B. Ames in Montréal. Published under the title The City Below the Hill, the study illuminated the conditions of the poorest residents of Montréal. Other studies by social reformers, such as J.J. Kelso in Toronto and J.S. Woodsworth in Winnipeg, contributed to an understanding of poverty and what could be done to alleviate it. These studies led to an emerging urban reform movement.</p>
                    <p><span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Scientific philanthropy</span> was a movement first undertaken in England in the 1860s by members of the Protestant social and economic elite in an effort to curtail urban poverty and begging. The notion of scientific philanthropy departed from moral judgements of deservedness and was rooted instead in the ideals of social reform and progress that were becoming popular at the time. A person in need was now seen as having an objective problem, and the role of the relief worker was to help him or her deal with the problem. Gathering factual information would lead to an understanding of the causes of the person’s problem, and in turn, to a solution. The theory underlying scientific philanthropy was that “the scientific spirit pointed toward self-correction and consensus” (Leiby, 1978: 91).</p>
                    <p>The gradual shift from private charity work toward more social scientific methods occurred more or less at the same time in Britain, the United States, and Canada. Between 1877 and 1920, scientific charity spread rapidly to most northeastern and midwestern large- and medium-sized cities in the United States, and from there, to Canada.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the social survey research studies mentioned above, the federal government launched scientific inquiries into the factors underlying social ills and disparities. Royal Commissions, such as the Dominion Commission on the Relations of Labour and Capital (1889), the Ontario Royal Commission on the Prisons (1890), and the Dominion Board of Inquiry into the Cost of Living (1915), also contributed to increased awareness of the social causes of poverty and inequity and a growing interest in social service and social work.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, the shift to scientific philanthropy provided the foundation for the birth of social work as a profession.</p>

                    <p>Modern <span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-6">casework</span>—the use of systematic methods of investigation, assessment, and decision making in social work practice—was strongly influenced by Mary Richmond (1861–1928), who worked for the Charity Organisation Societies of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Richmond argued that the casework technique could approach a “scientific understanding of social dynamics and human behaviour” (Pitsula, 1979: 39). Her 1917 text, Social Diagnosis, was used in the training of relief workers, and its contents reflect “the strong influence played by medicine in Miss Richmond’s conception of social casework” (Coll, 1973: 85–86). In Social Diagnosis, Richmond describes the social work process as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">1) Collection of social data on family history, and data pertaining to the problem at hand;</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">2) Critical examination of the material, leading to diagnosis; and</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">3) Development of a case plan with the involvement of the client.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In her analysis of social work, Richmond used the term “diagnosis” deliberately, borrowing the term from medicine. Her thinking became the basis of what would become known as the “medical model” of social work.</p>
                    <p>The Social Service Commission in Toronto first introduced the practice of professional casework in Canada. The Commission was appointed by the city in 1911, and employed staff who were paid for their work. It requested that the House of Industry in Toronto hire paid staff to operate their relief program. The distribution of relief was coordinated according to modern social work principles, as described in the Commission’s 1916 annual report:</p>
                    <p><em>Distress is relieved with care and sympathy, but the emphasis is not placed on mere relief giving. With each family helped, the work includes co-operation with other agencies, diagnosis of need, decision as to remedy, application of remedy, subsequent care, and tabulation of results. This is not haphazard “tinkering” with human beings but a real effort to render constructive and progressive service (Social Service Commission, 1916).</em></p>
                    <p>In 1914, the University of Toronto established a Department of Social Services for the scientific study of society. This was the first program in Canada to undertake the task of training social workers. In 1918, McGill University opened Canada’s second English-language social work training program, the School of Social Study and Training.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Shift from Moral to Social Reform</p>
                    <p>After World War I (1914-1918), the emergent social work profession was called upon to assist with the resettlement of war veterans and with others who were not poor but who needed assistance. In 1918, Charlotte Whitton was chosen to assist the Reverend J.G. Shearer at the Social Service Council of Canada, and she thus began a period of 25 years of intense involvement in social work and in the development of the social services. By 1921, the Social Service Council had become the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Public Health, illustrating the shift from the premise of moral to social reform.</p>
                    <p>In fact, social work gradually became a secular and scientific alternative to moral and religious endeavours to help disadvantaged members of society. As this replacement occurred during the early part of the twentieth century, however, religious faith continued to be central to the practice of a great deal of social work, as the next section describes.</p>

                    <p>During this era of social reform, Canadian social work was strongly influenced by the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">Social Gospel movement.</span> In the latter part of the nineteenth century, campaigns for a more socially oriented church, one that would apply Christian ethics to social problems, began to appear within the major Protestant churches. Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist church members pushed for a &ldquo;social gospel&rdquo; concerned with justice and social action. Their interests included social inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, the environment, child labour, labour rights, education, and the impending danger of war. Black denominations, especially the African Methodist Episcopal church (AME) and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church (AMEZ), actively supported the movement, as well.</p>

                    <p>The Social Gospel wings of these churches started many of the settlement houses in Canada, offering services such as daycare, education, and health care to needy people in poor neighborhoods. The YMCA, which had been created mid-century to help rural youth adjust to the city without losing their religion, had by the 1890s become a powerful instrument of the Social Gospel movement.</p>
                    <p>In 1907, the main Protestant churches established the Moral and Social Reform League. The League became the Social Service Council of Canada in 1914, with the Reverend J.G. Shearer serving as its first director. The Council remained the main social service advocacy organization in Canada for the next 20 years. Several leading members of Canada&rsquo;s trade union movement were active in the Council. After 1925, however, it declined in significance and was replaced by the Canadian Association of Social Workers in 1927.</p>
                    <p>The Social Gospel movement had especially strong supporters in Canada&rsquo;s prairie provinces. J.S. Woodsworth was born in Ontario in 1874 and was raised in Manitoba. He became interested in social welfare work while studying at Oxford University in England. He returned to Canada, took a position as a Methodist minister in Winnipeg, and began working with the city&rsquo;s poor immigrants. He helped develop the efforts of social workers there, which then spread to other parts of Canada. Woodsworth founded and served as secretary of the Social Welfare League in 1913. As part of the settlement house movement, he created the All People&rsquo;s Mission, which provided a variety of direct social services. He campaigned for compulsory education, juvenile courts, and the construction of playgrounds. In the 1930s, Woodsworth and Alberta MP William Irvine founded the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), later the New Democratic Party, on Social Gospel principles. The CCF, led by Tommy Douglas (himself a Baptist minister), took power in Saskatchewan in 1944 and introduced universal medicare, family allowance, and old-age pensions.</p>
                    <p>Social Gospel reformers such as Woodsworth were greatly influenced by (and greatly influenced) the Canadian labour movement, particularly with regard to worker control of enterprises and workers&rsquo; direct participation in decision making.</p>
                    <p>In the churches, this spirit manifested itself as the social gospel, implying the achievement of justice in this world rather than in the next. For these reformers, service to other human beings was considered a form of service to God. Many Canadian historians, such as Ramsey Cook (1985), view social work as the secular replacement of the social gospel movement.</p>

                    <p><span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-8">The Great Depression</span> of the 1930s left an indelible mark on Canadian society and on the emerging social work profession. This was an extremely difficult time of mass unemployment, widespread hardship, and seriously reduced living standards. In 1933, for example, nearly one quarter of the labour force was unemployed. For many Canadians, the Depression shattered forever the idea that market forces should be left unregulated. Most people came to view unemployment as a socio-economic problem requiring a national response, rather than as a personal problem to be solved by charity. During this period, attitudes changed greatly, as did Canadian political life. The late 1920s and the 1930s saw intense class conflict, as well as trade union development and militancy.</p>
                    <p>This period saw remarkable growth in the number of social workers. The 1941 census recorded 1,805 social workers in Canada, which represented a 65 percent increase from 1931. During this decade, expanding social service agencies administered relief to a large percentage of the population. &ldquo;During the harsh social conditions of the winter of 1931,&rdquo; note social historians Therese Jennissen and Colleen Lundy, &ldquo;social workers were overburdened with people in need&rdquo; (Jennissen and Lundy, 2006).</p>
                    <p>The Great Depression played a significant role in the shaping of Canada&rsquo;s welfare state and in the expansion of the social work profession. It ultimately led to the establishment of government-funded social programs and a growing need for trained social workers to run these programs. Today, social workers are employed in a variety of fields, serving many diverse populations, and the profession continues to pursue its mission of achieving social justice and ensuring the welfare of all Canadians.</p>

                                        <p>From the early part of the seventeenth century to the 1960s, health and social services for the large francophone majority of Québec were operated and often controlled by the Catholic Church. Services for the much smaller anglophone minority were offered by Protestant, Jewish, or lay organizations. Most schools in Québec were either staffed by religious orders or had a significant presence of these orders.</p>
                                        <p>All of this changed in the 1960s when Québec entered a period known as the Quiet Revolution.</p>
                                        <p>This period was marked by a radical transformation of Québec society as the state took control of health and social services. Nevertheless, to understand the history of social work in Québec, one needs to look first at the role played by the Catholic Church.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Canada’s First Social Worker?</p>
                                        <p>The first services provided to French settlers were developed by someone who has been called Canada’s first social worker (Yelaja, 1985). Marguerite Bourgeoys (1620–1700) was a native of Troyes, France. In 1640, she joined an organization of women tasked with educating poor girls, whose families could not afford to send them to live with and be educated by the cloistered nuns at the monastery. The director of this group of teachers was the sister of the Sieur de Maisonneuve, who had founded Ville-Marie (now Montréal) in 1642.</p>
                                        <p>Because she was a layperson and not a cloistered nun, Marguerite was chosen to accompany de Maisonneuve back to Montréal. She arrived in New France in 1653 with a personal mission to educate children and, in 1658, she opened a girls’ school in an abandoned stable.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to teaching, Marguerite provided support to <span class="CharOverride-2">les filles du roi,</span> or “the daughters of the king,” orphaned girls who had been sent from France to marry French settlers. She also founded a community of non-cloistered women (the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montréal), and opened a girls’ boarding school in Montréal, a school for Indigenous youth, and a school to teach home economics to young women.</p>
                                        <p>Marguerite devoted her life to promoting education and social support to French settlers and earned the title of the patron saint of Québec educators. After a long illness, she died in Montréal in 1700. She was beatified in 1950 and canonized in 1982 (Stanké, 1987).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Pre-Confederation Health and Social Services</p>
                                        <p>Before Confederation, Québec’s population was concentrated in the rural areas along the shores of the St. Lawrence River. An informal support system in rural villages was well established. In times of need, people were expected to turn first to their families, followed by their parish, and, in extreme cases, to the state. During this period, the population did not see a need for a profession such as social work. However, this did not mean that rural families were not in need of help in one form or another. Fecteau (1989) points out that famine and epidemics, for example, were a normal part of people’s lives.</p>
                                        <p>During these early years, Québec modelled its programs for needy citizens after those in France, which included three types of institutions:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--chart">
                                            <li class="li--bullet">the Hôtels-Dieu, which took care of sick people who had no families;</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">the Hôtels-généraux, which looked after poor homeless people; and</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">les bureaux des pauvres, which were established in Québec City, Montréal, and Trois Rivières. These “offices of the poor” were supervised by a priest who organized periodic collections and then distributed the funds to the needy (Ives, Denov, and Sussman, 2015).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Another charitable organization imported from France was the St. Vincent de Paul Societies. These societies were first established in Québec City in 1846 and spread throughout the province, providing support to poor people, elderly individuals, migrants, and orphans (Ives et al., 2015).</p>
                                        <p>The role of the Catholic Church in Québec during this early period, however, is still a matter of debate. Some historians remain convinced that the Church was responsible for all programs and services, but Mayer (2002) cautions that, while it did have an influential role and provided most of the direct services, it did not have complete autonomy. Many of the activities of the Church in providing assistance were controlled by the state through a variety of laws.</p>
                                        <p>Fecteau (1989) also argues that the Catholic Church played a less important role than is commonly believed. According to Fecteau, the lower clergy would have filled the role of informants about the level of poverty but would not normally have provided direct support, such as financial assistance or food. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Church played an important role in the practice and the evolution of social work (van de Sande, Beauvolsk, and Renault, 2011).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">From Confederation to the Depression</p>
                                        <p>Canada after Confederation was characterized by rapid industrialization. As was the case elsewhere in Canada, the urban population in Québec saw rapid growth, particularly in Montréal. This growth was based on two factors: immigration and internal migration. The rural villages were abandoned for work <a href="#" id="page-48" class="ch-link">opportunities in factories</a> located in the large urban centres. Working conditions were very difficult. The workers, including children, put in long hours at very low wages and without protection against disease or work-related accidents.</p>
                                        <p>It was not until the early 1930s, during the Great Depression, that social work as a profession appeared in French Canada. The working conditions of the lower class had already attracted the attention of the affluent class, mostly women, who worked as volunteers and provided assistance to poor families. These women, who were the forerunners of professional social workers, based their charitable activities on the belief that the poor were in their situation because of moral and spiritual weakness (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>
                                        <p>In 1934, through the efforts of l’Abbé Charles-Édouard Bourgeois, the first social work agency opened its doors in Trois Rivières, Québec. It was operated by the Catholic Diocese of the region of Trois Rivières and became a model for agencies across the province (Ives et al., 2015).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Birth of a Profession</p>
                                        <p>The needs of poor and destitute people during the Depression were so great, however, that they overwhelmed the capacity of these early social workers. It became apparent that paid professionals with special training were needed. The only professional training available at that time was at the Montréal School of Social Work at McGill University, an English institution. Because of the belief that the School of Social Work at McGill was based on a Protestant philanthropic and neutral perspective, a francophone Québecer wishing to study there needed special permission from the Archbishop (Groulx,&#160;1983).</p>
                                        <p>The first person to take the initiative to develop a francophone school of social work was Sister Marie Gérin-Lajoie. Having been influenced by Mary Richmond and the Charity Organisation Society, as well as by Jane Addams and the settlement house movement, Sister Marie Gérin-Lajoie was the first French-Canadian woman to receive a university degree. She went on to study social work at Columbia University in New York City. In 1922 she founded the Institut Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Conseil for women interested in Catholic social work practice. The Institute conferred its first social work diploma in 1934 (Mayer, 2002).</p>
                                        <p>In large part because Gérin-Lajoie was a woman and did not have the support of the clergy, the Institute was not well accepted by the Québec establishment. It was left to l’Abbé Lucien Desmarais to open the first school of social work in 1940. This school was annexed to the University of Montréal in 1942. A year later, Laval University opened its school of social work. During this period, social work schools and agencies were heavily influenced by Catholic values, and the main intervention approach was “casework,” which was primarily based on a Freudian theoretical orientation (Mayer, 2002).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The “Hands-Off” Approach of Maurice Duplessis</p>
                                        <p>The 1940s and 1950s in Québec were designated as <span class="CharOverride-2">la grande noirceur,</span> “the great darkness” (Mayer, 2002: 212). Québec was under the control of the National Union government of Maurice Duplessis (shown below), premier from 1944 to 1959. <a href="#" id="page-49" class="ch-link">While the federal government in Ottawa</a> used the report published in 1943 by Leonard Marsh as a model for the development of the Canadian version of the welfare state, the Québec government chose to go in the opposite direction, favouring a “laissez-faire” approach to the economy and to social security (Vaillancourt, 1988). Supported by the alliance between the Québec establishment and the Catholic Church, the Duplessis government believed that the responsibility for the poor rested with municipalities and parishes, and not with the provincial government (Mayer, 2002).</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">The Revolutionary 1960s</p>
                                        <p>As stated earlier, everything changed during the 1960s, when Québec experienced its Quiet Revolution. The state took back control of health and social services, and the Catholic Church lost much of its influence. The professionalization of social work was strengthened by the creation of <span class="CharOverride-2">la Corporation des travailleurs sociaux professionnels du Québec</span> in 1958. The organization was legally incorporated in 1960 (van de Sande et al., 2011) and is now known as<span class="CharOverride-2"> l’Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et des thérapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Québec</span>.</p>
                                        <p>The <span class="CharOverride-2">Castonguay-Nepveu Report,</span> published in 1971, provided a blueprint for the complete reorganization of health and social services. During this period, three other events contributed to the professionalization of social work: 1) the creation of the Ministry of Social Affairs in 1970, 2) the adoption of the act respecting health and social services (Bill 65) in 1971, and 3) the establishment of the new public health system and social services of Québec in 1972 (Mayer, 2002).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Recent Decades of Cutbacks</p>
                                        <p>The 1960s and 1970s were characterized by an interventionist policy on the part of Québec in the field of health and social services, but the decades since then have seen a complete reorganization of the “welfare state” and major cutbacks in services. Successive recessions (for example, the oil crisis of 1973 and the economic crisis of 1981) and inflation combined with stagnation convinced governments in Ottawa and Québec that poverty and unemployment are influenced by global economic factors and that government intervention alone will not solve these problems.</p>
                                        <p>The government’s priority was to make the economies of Canada and Québec more competitive in the face of a growing deficit. This was done through budget cuts to social programs, cuts to unemployment insurance benefits and social assistance, and tax cuts. The federal government in Ottawa significantly reduced its contributions to provincial programs, including health, education, and housing, forcing the provinces to transfer financial responsibility for programs such as child care and housing to municipalities or individuals.
                                            <br />These “neo-liberal” measures did result in reduced government deficits and a more competitive economy, but also caused considerable increases in poverty and unemployment levels (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>
                                        <p>The economic and social policies of Québec and Canada during this period significantly impacted the practice of social work. While the literature reflected an exploration of alternative approaches based on Marxist and feminist principles, the daily practices in state-regulated agencies, such as those for the protection of children and young offenders, were characterized by more bureaucratic control. In Québec, the Rochon Commission was very critical of the functioning of health and social services. Several measures were proposed to make these programs operate more efficiently (Mayer, 2002). Meanwhile, community organizations saw their budgets cut or redirected. Inevitably, many began to take short-term, task-oriented approaches to counselling (van de Sande et al., 2011).</p>
                                        <p>Since 2000, previous reforms have continued, fostering the emergence of new service arrangements. In 2001, the Clair Commission published its report on the functioning of the health and social services and made recommendations for better “governance” of the network, with increased pressure to privatize health services (Mayer, 2002). The great reform of 2004 was another important turning point, which saw the creation of health and social service centres and transformed the relationship between social and medical professions. This new streamlining took place across the province and resulted in a merger of institutions. Health and social service programs were grouped by region or sub-region and administered by one body (Rondeau and Commelin, 2005). The impact of these reforms on the profession of social work in Québec has not been entirely positive. According to Carignan (2014), the Québec government has made a concerted effort to bureaucratize and de-professionalize social work, resulting in a loss of its professional autonomy. Carignan adds that social workers in Québec are now faced with having their practice regulated by a set of very specific competencies.</p>
                                        <p>Social work and social services in Québec have evolved dramatically since colonial days, when they were dominated by the Catholic Church. The 1960s and 1970s brought the Quiet Revolution, an era of state intervention which saw the Church’s influence decline. This was followed by a reduction of state-sponsored programs, a bureaucratization of the social work profession, and an off-loading of services to the private sector. Clearly, social work in Québec has gone through tremendous change. It will continue to evolve, and despite its challenges, it has earned recognition as an essential part of the health and social services system in Québec.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><a href="#" id="page-50" class="ch-link">The Mid-Twentieth Century: The Era of Applied Social Science</a></p>
                    <p>During World War II (1939-1945), the Canadian federal and provincial governments began to realize that social services were not a luxury, but a vital part of a smoothly functioning economy. These services were required to assist the many returning war veterans and their families. The war ended a period of massive unemployment, sped up industrialization and urbanization, doubled the number of women in the labour force, and increased, and legitimized, government intervention in the economy.</p>
                    <p>In the post&ndash;World War II period, a time of rapid economic growth and mass consumption, career opportunities for social workers began to open up. As a more scientific view of human services emerged, the education of social workers gradually shifted from agency-based, volunteer training to a university-based, professional formal education. Originally based on the concept of charity, social work had evolved from a set of rules to guide volunteers helping the poor into a philosophy that embodied many of the principles of modern casework and techniques that could be transmitted by education and training (Woodroofe, 1962: 54). Social work in Canada had gained professional prominence in 1927 when the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) was established. In 1947, the first professional social work degree (Master of Social Work) was offered by the University of Toronto. In 1966, the university awarded the first Bachelor of Social Work degree (Armitage, 1970).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Aftermath of World War II</p>
                    <p>Following World War II, the federal Liberal government legislated a series of social welfare measures that were, in retrospect, seemingly intended to forestall the election of more CCF party members to the House of Commons. The CCF had achieved considerable popularity during the war with a social reform platform. The Liberals were also concerned with the possibility of a recession, which could cause considerable social unrest. The federal government therefore introduced the Family Allowance, which put more funds into the hands of families, helping to spur more economic growth. In 1951, through a constitutional amendment, the federal government introduced a federally financed and administered universal Old Age Pension. Several years later, they introduced benefit programs for persons with disabilities.(See Chapter 13 for more information about this topic.)</p>
                    <p>Many of these programs led to the expansion of employment in the administration of new services and programs, precipitating a fundamental change in the nature of Canadian social work and the emergence of a profession. Social work opportunities were now shifting from mainly private, volunteer agencies to government departments or government-financed agencies.</p>
                    <p>The ideas of Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) had an impact on how social workers practised their profession during this period. Debate occurred between the adherents of the Freudian or diagnostic approach and the newer functional approach. In the <span class="span-keyword text--red" id="kc-9">diagnostic approach</span>, emphasis was placed on understanding the psychic condition of the individual by reference to causal events in his or her early life. This approach required a skilled worker who could diagnose the problem and carry out a plan for treatment.</p>
                    <p><span class="span-keyword text--red">The functional approach</span> was based more on the belief in the potential of clients to determine their own direction in life with the assistance of a skilled social worker. The role of the worker was to establish a sound, structured relationship with the client and thereby to facilitate a process of personal change (Goldstein, 1973: 38&ndash;39).</p>

                    <p>In the 1960s, the social work profession renewed its interest in poverty as a result of anti-poverty measures instituted by the federal government. Community organizing initiatives sprang up in major cities across the country. In Ontario, a second generation of more radical social workers unionized, forming the Federation of Children&rsquo;s Aid Staff in the early 1970s. Several years later, this group of unions joined the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which today represents a large number of social workers who are employed by municipalities across the country.</p>
                    <p>A range of new models of social work practice also appeared in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the generic or integrated approach, the problem-solving approach, the behaviour modification approach, and the structural approach. The latter was based, in part, on a critique of approaches to individual and family social work that tended to seek explanations for and solutions to problems within the individual alone and not within the institutions or structures of society. (See Chapter 4.)</p>

                    <p>Despite the economic expansion of the post-war years, demands on private organizations for relief grew. The few church and private charities could not keep up. Pressure was put on the federal government by these organizations and by the Canadian Welfare Council, which presented the case for a national program of support for those who were unemployed but not eligible for other assistance.</p>
                    <p>The 1956 Unemployment Insurance Act provided federal assistance to the provinces for the so-called unemployed but employable person who did not have access to other income security programs or employment income. A condition of this assistance was that the province could not impose a residency requirement on an applicant.</p>
                    <p>This federal legislation marked the beginning of modernization of relief administration, which led to the passage of the Canada Assistance Plan in 1966. By offering to share 50 percent of the provincial costs of welfare and social services, the federal government effected key changes in Social Assistance, transforming it into a publicly financed and administered program. This was accompanied by a rapid expansion of social services in child welfare, child care, and other services for people in need.</p>
                    <p>The period from 1963 to 1973 saw the expansion of income security and social service programs. By the end of this period, Canada had become a welfare state with a public system of health and hospital care and expanded or new income security programs for children, the unemployed, single parents, and persons with disabilities.</p>
                    <p>Public or publicly financed social services, including child welfare and child care, were also expanded, many of which were extended for the first time to meet the needs of the Indigenous population, including those on reserves. Social workers were required to administer these new programs and deliver the expanded services. The number of persons who identified themselves as social workers in the census rose from 3,495 in 1951 to 30,535 in 1971; most of that increase occurred in the decade following 1961.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Increasing Demand for Social Work Programs</p>
                    <p>This increased demand for trained social work staff led to increased enrolment in college and university social work programs. The Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (CASSW) was established in 1967 to oversee professional university-based education programs in Canada. Currently, there are 34 universities and 46 colleges providing social work and social service education. Social workers now earn wages that are comparable to nurses and teachers, with hospitals and child welfare agencies currently employing the largest numbers of social workers.</p>
                    <p>At its inception, casework was the predominant form of social work practice, but by the mid-twentieth century both group work and community work were added to approaches to social work. Additionally, some universities have recognized social administration and social policy as important areas of practice. By the 1970s, there was a proliferation of approaches that included both diagnostic and functional approaches, as well as the generalist, the problem-solving, and the structural approaches&mdash;all testifying to the importance of the field of social work to the Canadian society and economy. (Chapter 3 will explore the characteristics of these approaches in greater detail.)</p>

                    <p>Today, each Canadian province and territory has legislation governing the practice of social work. The primary purpose of regulatory legislation is to protect the public through the oversight of social work practice. Provincial/territorial legislation governs who can use the title of social worker, requires a public register of regulated social workers, and outlines a process for investigating complaints. In most Canadian jurisdictions, the social work profession&rsquo;s regulatory body is separate from its advocacy association. </p>
                    <p>The British Columbia Social Workers Act (2008) serves to control the titles &ldquo;Registered Social Worker&rdquo; (R.S.W.) and &ldquo;Social Worker,&rdquo; allowing exemptions for certain situations. The Act established the British Columbia College of Social Workers, which maintains a continuing competence program to promote high standards of practice. It also stipulates the requirements for full registration as a social worker, including the successful completion of an exam. </p>
                    <p>Similarly, in Manitoba, The Social Work Profession Act (2009), proclaimed into law in 2014, oversees professional designations to protect the public interest and promote public confidence in the profession of social work. The Manitoba College of Social Workers also recently introduced a continuing competence program, with the first reporting cycle to begin in 2017. </p>
                    <p>The Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers protects the interest of the public by regulating social work practice through the Social Work and Social Service Work Act (1998). This Act also stipulates a mandatory continuing competence program. Hearings of the College&rsquo;s Discipline Committee are posted and open to the public.</p>

                                            <p>This paper explores how the propensity of social workers to make a direct and unmitigated connection between good intentions, rational thought, and good outcomes forms a white-noise barrier that substantially interferes with our ability to see negative outcomes resulting directly or indirectly from our works. The paper begins by outlining the harm experienced by Aboriginal children, before exploring how two fundamental philosophies that pervade social service practice impact Aboriginal children: 1) an assumption of pious motivation and effect, and 2) a desire to improve others. Finally, the paper explores why binding reconciliation and child welfare are a necessary first step toward developing social work services that better support Aboriginal children and families.</p>
                                        </blockquote>
                                        <p>Social workers have significant impacts on the lives of children and families every day—especially children experiencing maltreatment. The beliefs that we know what good is, are good, and can instill good in others, are so ingrained in the social work fabric that there is little meaningful conversation about our potential to do harm. Even when confronted by graphic evidence of harm arising from social work actions, our historical response has often been to protect ourselves from seeing what we perhaps fear the most—we, the good guys, doing the harm.</p>
                                        <p>This piece begins by reflecting on social work policies and practices with Aboriginal children that have been termed “poor practice” by many, and “cultural genocide” by some (Balfour, 2004), before urging the social work profession to actively engage in a meaningful process of reconciliation with Aboriginal peoples.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">What’s the Harm?</p>
                                        <p>Herwitz (2003) argues that the first step in reconciliation is to understand the harm by hearing it in a way that cannot be rationalized or abided. This is a fundamental first step for social work. We must learn from our professional past in order to avoid replicating past mistakes with Aboriginal peoples and other groups. Elder Wilma Guss (2004) suggests that those who did the harm do not have the right to define it or define the solutions to redress it. The definition of harm and the solutions to the harm are the first property of those who experienced it. This piece argues that a lack of knowledge and critical reflection on social work’s role in colonialism erodes our ability to work effectively with Aboriginal peoples and engage in reconciliation.</p>
                                        <p>Aboriginal peoples have lived on the lands now known as Canada for thousands of years (Muckle, 1999). These diverse and complex societies embrace different linguistic, cultural, political, and spiritual systems reflecting their distinct ecological settings. Despite their diversity, Aboriginal peoples share a common belief in the interdependence of all living, spiritual, and physical forms; a preference for communal rights; and a high regard for knowledge handed down in a sacred trust from one generation to another (Auger, 2001). These beliefs influenced all ways of knowing and being, including systems for caring and educating children and youth (Auger, 2001; Sinclair, Bala, Lilles, and Blackstock, 2004). No society was ever without its challenges, and each community had laws and responses to help children who were receiving inadequate care. These responses included placement of the child with other community members, conflict resolution, and redistribution of community resources to ensure parents could care for their children (Blackstock, 2003). Unlike in today’s social work practice, placement outside of the home never resulted in the complete severance of a parent’s responsibility for the child. Parental roles were simply redefined so that the parent could safely and properly support their child to the degree they were able (Auger, 2001). To my knowledge, no Aboriginal language in Canada has a word for child removal or apprehension as defined in contemporary child welfare law.</p>
                                        <p>Aboriginal concepts and systems of care sustained generations of Aboriginal children until the British and French arrived on the eastern shores of what is now North America in the late 1400s and early 1500s. At the time, both colonial powers were<a href="#" id="page-56" class="ch-link"> feudal monarchies</a> interested in expanding their respective empires, with limited compromise or respect for the “savages” who lived on the new lands (Canada, 1996). Although the earliest contact was described as mutually beneficial, as Europeans traded survival information and trade access for goods, it changed when European motivations shifted to settlement and resource extraction. Colonial powers initiated efforts to eradicate the Indians<span class="span--number">2</span> through the intentional introduction of diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis, removal of Indians from their traditional lands, imposition of restrictions of Indian movements, reckless harvesting of natural resources, and, upon Confederation, the regulation of Indians and lands reserved for Indians through the federal government’s Indian Act (Canada, 1996).</p>

                                        <p>Deaths from disease, starvation, and willful murder related to colonization resulted in the complete eradication of some Indian communities, such as the Beothuck of Newfoundland, and an overall 80 percent (approx. 400,000) reduction in the Indian population from the time of contact until 1871 (Canada, 1996). This loss of life was most significantly experienced by Aboriginal children who, along with being the most vulnerable to death by disease, also experienced the profound grief associated with losing so many members of their family and community.</p>
                                        <p>This harm was compounded by Canada’s introduction of compulsory attendance at residential schools designed to assimilate Indian children and thereby eliminate what senior government officials termed “the Indian problem.”<span class="span--number">3</span> These schools, run by Christian churches and funded by the federal government, operated from the time of Confederation until 1996, when the last one closed in Saskatchewan (Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2003). The Indian Act authorized Indian Agents to remove every Indian child between 5 and 15 years old from their parents’ care and place them in often distant residential schools. The schools themselves were poorly constructed, using the cheapest possible material and workmanship, and thus were prolific incubators for the spread of tuberculosis and smallpox. In fact, Duncan Campbell Scott, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the first three decades of the twentieth century, estimated that up to 50 percent of Indian children died in the schools from disease or maltreatment (Milloy, 1999). The federal government was advised of the problem by Dr. P.H. Bryce, Indian Affairs Medical Officer, as early as 1907, but its efforts to rectify the situation were inadequate and lacked any sustained effort. In fact, the lack of government action motivated Bryce to publish his findings in magazines and newspapers, hoping that the public would become enraged and force the government into positive action. Sadly, despite Bryce’s best efforts, the reports were met with silence and had little effect on government policy and practice (Milloy, 1999). This inaction prompted Queens Council S.H. Blake to note that “in that the government fails to obviate the preventable causes of death, it brings itself in unpleasant nearness to manslaughter” (Milloy, 1999: 77).</p>
                                        <p>There was child maltreatment as well. Throughout the history of residential schools, dating back as early as 1896, Indian Agents and others advised the federal government of life-threatening incidents of physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and servitude (Canada, 1996; Milloy, 1999). Even after several deaths due to child maltreatment were reported, the federal government and the churches failed to implement measures necessary to protect Indian children (Milloy, 1999). Residential schools began closing in the mid 1940s, with the last federally-run school finally closing its doors in 1996.</p>
                                        <p>There is very little evidence that the voluntary sector, including human rights groups, did anything significant to disrupt residential schools or the colonial policies of government overall (Blackstock, 2009). Even though children’s aid societies had been operating in Ontario since the early 1900s (Sealander, 2003)—and thus logically must have been aware of Bryce’s frequent public statements about the preventable deaths of children in the schools—there is no record of a children’s aid society ever intervening. Even as reports of abuse and neglect at the schools increased across the country, I know of no records suggesting that children’s aid organizations took note of the reports or did anything meaningful to intervene. A joint submission to the Senate and House of Commons in 1946 by the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) and the Canadian Welfare Council (CWC) indicates that social workers were well aware of the residential schools (Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons, 1946). The CASW and CWC joint submission suggested that Aboriginal peoples should be assimilated into Canadian society, and although shortcomings with the residential schools were acknowledged, the CASW and CWC noted that “[W]e feel they [residential schools] have a place in a well-rounded system of Indian education, particularly insofar as they meet special needs.”<span class="span--number">4</span> Even if one argued that the CASW and CWC did not, for some reason, know about the prolific and preventable deaths from tuberculosis and other factors at the time of their testimony, this was clearly outlined in other parts of the report where their own evidence is reproduced, and yet there is no evidence that the CASW or CWC took up any meaningful campaigns to address the problems.</p>
                                        <p>To be fair, the CASW and CWC did successfully advocate with the federal government to ensure that child welfare services were provided to Indian children on reserves.<span class="span--number">5</span> However, this <a href="#" id="page-57" class="ch-link">advocacy was not accompanied</a> by a persistent campaign to close the residential schools themselves. In fact, social workers were active participants in the placement of Aboriginal children in residential schools as late as the 1960s (Caldwell, 1967; Canada, 1996).</p>
                                        <p>The professional oversight bodies did not effectively monitor the quality of child welfare services that mainstream social workers began providing on reserves. This lack of invigilation, accompanied by a systemic ignorance of the impacts of colonization, often resulted in the mass removal of Aboriginal children and their placement in non-Aboriginal homes—often permanently (Caldwell, 1967). This pattern of mass removals became known as the “60s scoop.” It was not unusual for so many children to be removed that a bus would be hired by child welfare workers to transport them out of the reserve (Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, 2002).</p>
                                        <p>Upon completing his investigation into the impacts of the 60s scoop practice on Aboriginal communities in Manitoba, Judge Edwin Kimmelman said that these mass removals amounted to “cultural genocide” (Balfour, 2004). Some provinces and territories responded to Kimmelman’s concerns by setting temporary moratoriums on the adoption of Aboriginal children by non-Aboriginal parents, but little was done to redress the poverty, social exclusion, and impacts of colonization that had resulted in these children being removed from their families in the first place.</p>
                                        <p>In the early 1980s, the federal government began to respond to First Nations demands to operate their own child welfare programs so they could stem the tide of children leaving the community. These programs, known as First Nations child and family service agencies, operate pursuant to provincial legislation and are funded by the federal government (MacDonald and Ladd, 2000). Although the agencies have made substantial gains in ensuring that services are culturally based and that children are given the best chance to stay in their community, they express concern regarding inequitable funding and the imposition of provincial legislation and standards that have substantially failed Aboriginal children (Blackstock, 2003). A national policy review conducted in 2000 confirmed First Nations concerns that the current funding structure from the federal government does not provide sufficient resources for children to stay safely in their home—although there is no funding cap on resources for children removed from their home (MacDonald and Ladd, 2000). A more recent and detailed analysis found that the funding inequality is in the order of $109 million per annum (Auditor General of Canada, 2008; Loxley et al., 2005). This means that at-home child maltreatment prevention services, which are broadly available to other Canadian children, are not provided to First Nations children on reserve, resulting in an astronomical over-representation of Status Indian<span class="span--number">6</span> children in care (Blackstock, 2009). Child in care data from three provinces indicates that 0.67 percent of non-Aboriginal children were in care as of May 2005, as compared to 10.23 percent of Status Indian children. Overall, Status Indian children were 15 times more likely to be placed in child welfare care than non-Aboriginal children (Blackstock, Prakash, Loxley, and Wien, 2005).</p>
                                        <p>As Maclean’s magazine (2004) noted, “the numbers of Status Indians taken into care has jumped by 71.5 percent between 1995 and 2001—something experts put down to the general level of poverty and relative underfunding of First Nations child welfare agencies—the situation can only fuel racial inequality and discord. In a verdict shared by adoption advocates across the country, ACC [Adoption Council of Canada] chair Sandra Scarth calls the overall situation ‘appalling’” (Ferguson, 2004).</p>
                                        <p>By 2007, the federal government had done little to redress the drastic funding shortfalls, prompting the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, alleging that the federal government’s conscious underfunding of child welfare amounted to racial discrimination within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The federal government did not actively dispute the central claim that child welfare funding is inequitable and yet pursued a plethora of technical objections in an apparent effort to derail or delay the hearing of this important case on its merits (Blackstock, 2009). The case went to trial before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2013 and concluded in the fall of 2014. The Tribunal released its landmark ruling in January of 2016, substantiating the discrimination complaint and ordering the federal government to cease its discriminatory practices (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2016 CHRT 2). Although this case was broadly covered in the Canadian press and the engagement of social workers is growing, support from non-Aboriginal social work organizations was not proportional to the gravity of the injustice at issue in this case.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Responding to the Harm: The Search for Social Work</p>
                                        <p>One would think that responding to the needs of First Nations children and families would be a national priority for social work—the reality is that it is not. Whilst social work authorities, academics, and professional bodies acknowledge the over-representation of Aboriginal children in care, they typically devote very limited financial resources or sustained effort to redress it. For example, in 2004 a provincial child welfare authority allocated only 20 percent of its family support <a href="#" id="page-58" class="ch-link">budget to Aboriginal families,</a> despite the fact that Aboriginal children comprised over 80 percent of all children in care (Flette, 2005). Another province only placed 2.5 percent of Aboriginal children in care with culturally matched homes, despite a statutory obligation to do so (British Columbia Children’s Commission, 1998). Additionally, although several non-Aboriginal social work regional and national umbrella organizations identify Aboriginal children as an organizational priority, an examination of programs, budgets, and outcomes rarely reflects any significant or sustained focus that is proportionate to the scope of the problem. From a research perspective, investment in national Aboriginal child welfare research is modest, representing approximately $350,000 in 2004, whereas keeping Status Indian children on-reserve in care cost the federal government over $300 million. By 2009, the reality was even more bleak, with a national investment of approximately $100,000, whilst the child welfare expenditures for First Nations children on-reserve had grown to well over $400 million due to rising rates. There are, of course, promising exceptions where social workers and social work organizations have meaningfully worked with First Nations to redress the over-representation of children in care, but these continue to be the exception. These positive examples need to be recognized and supported—but they should spur us on to further progressive action and not reinforce a professional slumber.</p>
                                        <p>Despite the indications that social work requires a courageous invigilation of its impacts on Aboriginal families, mainstream social work largely considers itself to have taken the steps necessary to insulate itself from its egregious actions of the past. We talk about the residential school and 60s scoop eras as if they were safely packed away. But is this true? Have we as social workers really learned from our past mistakes?</p>
                                        <p>The following sections explore how professional notions of improvement, professional piety, mandates and borders, and distorted knowledge and culturally appropriate services may have contributed to social work’s unfortunate history with Aboriginal peoples in Canada. This list is not exhaustive and is meant to inspire broad-based conversation to promote professional learning.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Both Sides of Improvement</p>
                                        <p>The notion of improving other people is endemic to social work. It is a source of both moral nobility and trepidation. It implies an ability to accurately define another’s deficit and to locate its importance in his or her life, and assumes the efficacy of external motivations and sensibilities to change. As interventions with Aboriginal children by non-Aboriginal helping professionals testify, there is a delicate balance between the freedom and dignity of individuals and societies at one end and cultural arrogance and oppression on the other.</p>
                                        <p>Research suggests that social workers should avoid drumming up solutions to “Aboriginal issues” by themselves and instead invest in a relationship where the right of Aboriginal peoples to make the best decisions affecting them is affirmed and supported. The wisdom of this approach is documented by Chandler and Lalonde (1998), who found that although First Nations children in British Columbia have one of the highest suicide rates in the world, more than 90 percent of the suicides occurred in 10 percent of the province’s First Nations communities. In fact, some First Nations reported a zero percent suicide rate over the 13 years prior to the study. Chandler and Lalonde (1998) wanted to know what differences existed between communities that could account for such a wide variation in suicide rates. Findings indicate that First Nations communities with a low suicide rate or no suicide rate exercised high levels of community-based decision making, as represented by First Nations service delivery in child welfare, health, education, and fire and police services. High levels of female participation in First Nations governments and advancement toward self-government were also factors. The work of Cornell and Kalt (1992) complements Chandler and Lalonde’s findings. They found that communities with sustained socio-economic development also had highly developed community decision-making authorities. They argue that effective capacity building must be preceded by affirmation of Aboriginal decision making. This finding challenges the assumption that Aboriginal peoples must build capacity to have decision making capacity passed to them.</p>
                                        <p>As Chandler and Lalonde (1998) observe, many Aboriginal communities have systems in place to prevent youth suicide, and these systems are so effective that their youth suicide rates are substantially lower than in non-Aboriginal communities. What is needed is to ensure that other Aboriginal communities have access to the information and resources needed to implement their own solutions.</p>
                                        <p>This does not mean that non-Aboriginal social service providers get to walk away. As many Elders have said, “We did not get here alone, and we are not leaving alone.” It does mean shifting the philosophy of our current social work practice away from one of solution holder and preferred service delivery agent to one where Aboriginal peoples make the best decisions for themselves. Non-Aboriginal peoples must play a critical and active role in making space for those decisions and in ensuring that adequate resources are available to implement them.</p>
                                        <p>As the following section argues, it will also require a critical analysis of other factors influencing the profession, such as the assumption of pious motivation and effect.</p>

                                        <p>The assumption of piety in social work blinds us from considering the need for anything along the lines of a Hippocratic Oath. The concept that we can do harm (or even evil) rarely appears on the optical radar screen of professional training, legislation, or practice as anything other than a tangential way through procedural mechanisms such as codes of ethics. This is particularly true for those of us who work with children—believing that those who want to do good and are trained to do good could cause harm to children is astonishing and upsets our sensibility of the world. Talking about it even seems too much, as it breathes life into its possibility so often we are silent.</p>
                                        <p>On the rare occasions when there are discussions of harm in social work, and in helping professions more broadly, they are predominated by inaccurate assumptions that incidents of harm will be obvious, that harm is done by others, that social workers will act out against it, and that when it does occur we will learn from it. We also wrongly assume that incidents are singular rather than systemic and that codes of ethics, professional training and standards, and anti-oppressive social work paradigms can prevent their insurgence and persistence.</p>
                                        <p>When evidence surfaces that harm has arisen directly from the actions or inactions of practitioners of social work or of other helping professions, we often default to rationalizing the occurrence as exceptional, using one of these predominant arguments: 1) they acted based on the sensibilities of the day—we know better now; 2) they did not know about the harm; 3) it was outside of their mandate, and; 4) if the harm is so appalling that it cannot be rationalized as coming from a place of good intentions, they were immoral or bad individuals who are exceptions to the group. We have also developed systemic approaches, such as the emphasis on culturally appropriate services, that, whilst holding great promise for supporting Aboriginal families, have also been misused as a means of limiting critical systemic analysis and professional action. This section deconstructs these rationalizations to try to understand why social workers and others have demonstrated very limited, if any, sustained activism against the multiple harms experienced by Aboriginal children.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">Sensibilities of the Day</li></p>
                                        
                                        <p>Some people rationalize the lack of social work efforts to stop residential schools by noting that child abuse has just recently surfaced on the societal radar screen as a problem deserving attention. The argument goes that “we had different standards back then—no one talked about child abuse” and thus it went unnoticed. But as John Milloy (1999) notes, the reports of child abuse at residential schools were made by people of the period who, given the sensibilities of those times, found the treatment of these children unacceptable. And yet, despite having received the reports, government officials typically did little to stop the abuse, and in some cases the death, of children.</p>
                                        <p>Today we have a significant evidence base to suggest that Aboriginal children and young people face pervasive risk in a way not experienced by other Canadians, and yet our professional response has been lukewarm (Blackstock, 2009; Blackstock, Clarke, Cullen, D’Hondt, and Formsma, 2004). We are now the people of the period who should find such disproportionate risk unacceptable—but our professional actions are not, in my view, in keeping with the crisis before us. It is as if we have edged our collective tolerance for the risks experienced by Aboriginal children upwards to a degree where it is difficult to imagine what threshold needs to be reached for the profession to take action in a meaningful way.</p>
                                        

                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">We Did Not Know</li></p>
                                        <p>Another way to rationalize the mediocre response of social work to residential schools is to argue that information on the deaths and abuse was not widely known until recently. As John Milloy (1999) notes, this argument is weak, as there was significant information on the abuse and deaths of children in residential schools, and this information was available to governments, academics, and the media. Nevertheless, the availability of this information failed to inspire progressive action to redress the abuse and murders at residential schools.</p>
                                        <p>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (Canada, 1996) found that social workers knew about residential schools and routinely served on admissions committees adjudicating child welfare placements in these schools (ibid.). In addition to serving on placement committees, social workers actually placed substantial numbers of Aboriginal children in residential schools. As the RCAP notes, “residential schools were an available and apparently popular option within the broader child care system” (Canada, 1996, Chapter 10, p.21). According to Caldwell (1967), child welfare placements accounted for over 80 percent of the admissions in six residential schools in Saskatchewan. Caldwell’s report outlines a number of shortcomings in the residential school program but even he, a social worker by training, did not recommend the closure of these schools. Caldwell did, however, go further than most other social workers of his time by recommending improvements to the residential school system.</p>
                                        <p>The temptation to believe “if we had only known—we would have acted differently” may provide some false comfort, but in the case of the social work profession, it did know and acted largely in complicit support of the residential school system. The application of the “if we only knew, we could act differently” argument has little merit in today’s context as well. Even <a href="#" id="page-60" class="ch-link">with multiple sources</a> of information documenting the relationship between structural risks (such as poverty, substance misuse, and poor housing) and child maltreatment (Auditor General of Canada, 2009; Blackstock, 2009; Trocmé, Knoke, &amp; Blackstock, 2004), efforts by social workers and others to prioritize, protest, and redress the harms experienced by Aboriginal children continue to be inadequate and piecemeal.</p>
                                        <p>We continue to confine our assessments of child risk to the family, which fetters our ability to identify risk factors that impact the child but that have their source outside of the sphere of influence of their parents. We have also done little to address the longstanding inequitable child welfare funding provided to First Nations children on reserves (Blackstock, 2009; First Nations Child and Family Caring Society et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2016 CHRT 2; Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2009). In missing these structural risks, we set up a situation where Aboriginal parents are held responsible for things outside of their control, and we deprive Aboriginal families of the same access to services as other Canadians to redress risk to children.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">We Are Needed</li></p>
                                        <p>So if information on its own is not enough to mobilize social workers, is it possible that by entrenching in the idea that social workers are positive agents for social well-being, we have unintentionally built a barrier that rebuffs or rationalizes information suggesting we are perpetrating harm? Take, for example, the assumption that social work is in the best position to respond to child maltreatment and neglect in Aboriginal communities. Increasing evidence suggests that Aboriginal communities, when provided with adequate supports, develop the most sustainable socio-economic improvements for children, and yet as a profession we continue to believe, almost at the exclusion of other options, that we are the best response. This should be a touchstone question for our profession, but it is rarely asked. Instead, we are busy developing programs and services to offer abused and neglected children and families instead of providing communities and families with the resources to implement their own best solutions (Blackstock and Trocmé, 2005).</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">Mandates and Borders</li></p>
                                        <p>Another way of rationalizing the harm is to claim it was outside of the mandate of the various helping professions or organizations to intervene. Take the case of Jordan, a First Nations boy from Norway House Cree Nation who was born in 1999 with complex medical needs. His family placed him in child welfare care—not because he was abused or neglected but because that was the only way the provincial and federal governments would provide the money required for Jordan’s special needs (Lavallee, 2005). (In a policy that baffles common sense, the federal government will not provide adequate support for special needs children on reserve—unless they are in child welfare care.) Shortly after Jordan’s second birthday, doctors agreed to allow him to return home, however, as Noni MacDonald and Amir Attaran (2007) of the Canadian Medical Association Journal note, “bureaucrats ruined it.” Jordan was a First Nations boy whose family lived on reserve, and unfortunately, provincial and federal governments do not agree on who is responsible for payment of services for children on reserve. The standard practice by both levels of government has been to defer or deny First Nations children the government services that are routinely available to other Canadian children until the dispute can be resolved, with little consideration for the child’s safety or well-being. For Jordan, provincial and federal bureaucrats argued over every item related to his at-home care, while he stayed in hospital at about twice the cost (Lavallee, 2005). Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and Jordan saw the seasons change through his hospital window. All the while, bureaucrats met somewhere, likely feeling good about “doing something about Jordan’s situation” while privileging their respective government’s desire to not pick up the tab. It seems that they became ethically blind to Jordan’s fate, and sadly, Jordan died waiting at five years of age, having never spent a day in a family home.</p>
                                        <p>This sad example shows just how easy it is for something as insignificant as a mandate to overshadow the precious life of a young boy. This astounding story is not unique. A recent study found that in 12 sample First Nations agencies, there were 393 jurisdictional disputes between governments around children’s services in the past year alone (Blackstock, Prakash, Loxley, and Wien, 2005). Governments put their needs ahead of children’s needs far too often. Jordan’s passing prompted the development of Jordan’s Principle, which is a child-first principle aimed at resolving government jurisdictional disputes. It is supported by over 9,900 individuals and organizations, including growing numbers of social work organizations and governments, and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal recently ordered the federal government to immediately cease applying its narrow definition of Jordan’s Principle. However, the reality is that no provincial/territorial or federal government in Canada has fully implemented this principle. I continue to receive reports of First Nations children who are being denied life-saving and wellness government services available to other children because of jurisdictional wrangling.</p>
                                        <p>I have often wondered what the provincial and federal officials involved were thinking when they allowed Jordan to languish in hospital. I have decided to believe that they were not evil people, and yet their collective actions had devastating <a href="#" id="page-61" class="ch-link">consequences for Jordan.</a> I have no good answers, as every rationale I come up that would help me understand what the bureaucrats were thinking seems so very weak in the face of Jordan’s needs.</p>
                                        <p>Mandates are both a necessary act of pragmatism and a cop- out. They are pragmatic because no profession or institution can manage it all, and they are a cop-out because they allow for inaction in the face of gross and demonstrated immorality. Perhaps part of the reason that good people can do such immoral things in the name of mandates is explained by the work of Zygmunt Bauman (1989), who argues that too often, our personal morality is usurped by our need to comply with what is deemed morally good by the institutions we are affiliated with or work with. He argues that there is a reason why whistle blowers are the exception—because they accomplish what is too rare, to break through the institutional moral code calling for company/professional loyalty to act on the basis of their moral conscience. In social work, we talk about social change, but we do not talk as honestly about how our bureaucracies often prefer conformity versus courageous conversation and innovation in child welfare (Blackstock, 2009). Social change is what we do externally—but not as often internally.</p>
                                        <p>The power of mandates and borders can also be more subtly shaped by interfaces between our national, professional, and personal ideologies and assumptions, which locate harm outside of what has already been deemed to be good. This partially explains why Canada, considered a bastion of human rights, was able to sign the Universal Declaration on Human Rights in the same year it was operating residential schools, did not recognize Indians as people under the law, and invited South African apartheid delegates to learn about its Indian pass system without any public protest by human rights organizations or institutions. It also partially explains why the government of British Columbia was able to run a referendum on Aboriginal treaty rights in 2002 while refusing to educate the public on the treaty process. This, the first referendum on minority rights, was held with only moderate intervention by human rights groups and only the modest disapproval of the federal government. As these examples illustrate, too often, non-government organizations (NGOs) and human rights organizations do not think to look within Canada for human rights transgressions; instead they focus abroad. As Aziz Choudry explains, “many social justice campaigns, NGOs, and activists in these countries operate from a state of colonial denial and refuse to make links between human rights abuses overseas, economic injustice, and the colonization of the lands and peoples where they live” (Choudry, 2001).</p>
                                        <p>It is easier to believe that some other society is perpetrating human rights abuses than to believe your own country and society are—because that frames the accountability on a more personal level to either do something or own the responsibility of remaining silent and still. There are few things more courageous than to stand up to people or a government that you respect and care for—especially for an interest outside of oneself. Bryce did it and should be celebrated as one of the great Canadian heroes.</p>

                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">Evil: A Domain of the Well-Intentioned?</li></p>
                                        <p>Another rationalization hinges on the propensity to believe that if we as social workers are well-intended in our actions, we are essentially absolved from moral responsibility, regardless of consequences. As Zygmunt Bauman (1989) notes, the idea that evil is obvious and perpetrated only by bad apples serves to absolve us all of being evil and affords a false security that we will know evil when we see it. As a child-protection worker, I have seen evil in its many faces, and it has rarely been obvious or predictable. It is more often grey than black and white. It can be multi-dimensional, rationalized, normative, and carried out by many instead of one. It often has benefits for someone, and those benefits can seductively legitimize the costs experienced by another. As John Milloy (1999) noted, the motivations of staff at the Department of Indian Affairs and those of the churches were not always evil in the way they understood evil to be—they used words like “civilizing,” “integrating,” and “educating” to describe what they were doing. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples echoes Milloy’s findings, noting that “[P]olitician, civil servant, and perhaps most critically, priest and parson felt that in developing the residential school system, they were responding not only to a constitutional but to a Christian ‘obligation to our Indian Brethren’ that could be discharged only ‘through the medium of children’ and therefore ‘education must be given its foremost place’” (Canada, Chapter 10, p.3). This created a moral cushion that blinded them to the end result of their actions, which some of their contemporaries, such as P.H. Bryce and S.H. Blake, found repugnant if not criminal.</p>
                                        <p>This moral cushion was strengthened by limited acts that workers carried out to try to redress the harm. These acts were often perfunctory and unmonitored, but served to liberate workers from the moral responsibility to do something. For example, upon hearing reports of child deaths and maltreatment, staffers would often issue edicts that said it was not to happen again, but nothing was done to ensure these edicts were followed up—even in the face of substantial evidence that the abuse was continuing.</p>
                                        <p>These cushions have served to comfort thousands of Canadians, including those active in human rights, the voluntary <a href="#" id="page-62" class="ch-link">sector, and academia</a> who either contributed to the harm or stood silent in its wake. Some lived near the residential schools, some read P.H. Bryce’s article in the magazine <span class="">Saturday Night</span>, and others saw the graveyards on residential school grounds or the buses collecting children from reserves to be placed in foster homes, and yet, except for some courageous instances, there was silence.</p>
                                        <p>Evil happens in degrees—there are those who beat children to death, those who issued edicts without following up, and those who lived next door and said nothing (Neiman, 2002). Are they all accountable? If so—how, and why? To what standard of courage and compassion should we hold social workers—are we willing to support them when they identify acts that upset our sensibilities, or are we as a society willing to tolerate their silence in the face of atrocities? These are difficult questions that have remained underground in social work and need to be unearthed if we are to deconstruct our professional past in a way that makes obvious the thinking that fuels colonization.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text--grey"><li class="li--bullet-item">Culturally-Appropriate Services: A Step Forward?</li></p>
                                        <p>In the absence of the recognition of Aboriginal child welfare laws, a subsidiary movement has developed to deliver “culturally-appropriate” services. This sounds good—it feels like we are moving in the right direction as a profession, but the problem is that few of us really understand what being culturally appropriate means. This is partly because few services are analyzed for their underpinning cultural value in order to determine what program elements are culturally predicated and on what culture. Too often, services are proclaimed culturally neutral, often by those whose cultures are embodied in the service, in the absence of any thorough analysis or search for perspective from other cultural groups. In the absence of this analysis, social workers can wrongly assume that nothing needs to be changed about the fundamental elements of the service—it just needs to be made “culturally appropriate” by adding in Aboriginal symbols or ceremonies. I am open to debate on this issue, but in my own experience, I have yet to see a Euro-Western program of any stature deconstructed from a value perspective by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples and then reconstructed on an Aboriginal value base.</p>
                                        <p>What we do know is that this movement toward culturally-appropriate services has gained increasing authority. Governments are amending their internal operational guidelines and contract service guidelines to require child welfare service providers ensure that Aboriginal children receive culturally-appropriate services. As a result, large numbers of organizations have begun to redefine their services as culturally appropriate. However, as there is an absence of guidelines and monitoring bodies for culturally-appropriate services, what began as an earnest attempt to better support Aboriginal children has largely degenerated into a movement that gains culturally-ascribed organizations social capital and funder recognition without having to critically evaluate the cultural efficacy and relevance of their programs. I argue that the focus on culturally-appropriate services takes attention away from the real need to affirm Aboriginal ways of knowing and caring for children. After all, the basic assumption underlying culturally- appropriate services is that one can adapt a mainstream model for application to Aboriginal children—without compromising the basic integrity of the service—including the values and beliefs that drive it. As Aboriginal values and beliefs respecting children are very divergent from Euro-Western understanding, marrying the two into a coherent and effective program for Aboriginal children is difficult. This difficulty has been well recorded by Aboriginal child welfare agencies, who describe the problems inherent in delivering child welfare services to Aboriginal children within the realm of Euro-Western legislation. Until there are effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms developed to measure the efficacy of culturally-appropriate services, we need to be vigilant about the usage of such terms and any conclusions we may draw between said services and the well-being of Aboriginal children.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Reconciliation and Social Work</p>
                                        
                                        <p>After former Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s apology for the wrongs done by the Government of Canada during the residential school era, reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians sounds like just the thing social work should be involved in—and it should. But not before it courageously engages in reconciliation itself. This means that social work must look in the professional mirror to see its history from multiple perspectives, including the perspectives of those who experienced the harm. We must look beyond our need to not feel blamed so we can learn and change our behaviour. It sounds trivial to write about the power of blame and shame among social workers, but I have seen its power. I have seen many bright and compassionate non-Aboriginal social workers raise walls of rationalization and distance to insulate themselves from it. As ostensible doers of good, we have not been trained to stand in the shadow of our harmful actions, so we ignore or minimize them. It is a privilege to put up those walls—to be able to insulate yourself from what happened. When Aboriginal people put up the walls, they are left alone to deal with the harm. When social workers put up the walls, they can pretend the pain does not exist at all and go about their daily business. The problem is that putting up the walls does not change the reality—Aboriginal peoples lost in colonization and social work did, too.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-63" class="ch-link">Social work misplaced its moral compass and in doing so perpetrated preventable harms to Aboriginal children.</a> It denied itself the opportunity to learn from Aboriginal cultures and make a meaningful contribution to the safety and well-being of Aboriginal children. As social workers, we must understand that our failure to engage in an internal process of reconciliation has immobilized our strength and efficacy.</p>
                                        <p>It is not enough to issue a statement on Aboriginal peoples from time to time or tinker with services if what social workers really want are justice, respect, and equality for Aboriginal children and young people. We must courageously redefine the profession using reconciliation processes and then move outward to expand the movement into society. In 2005, over 200 Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal experts in child welfare came together to develop a process for reconciliation in child welfare and five principles to guide the process, known as Reconciliation in Child Welfare: Touchstones of Hope for Indigenous Children, Youth, and Families (Blackstock et. al., 2006). The reconciliation process is described as having four phases (truth telling, acknowledging, restoring, and relating) and five principles to guide the process (self-determination, holistic approach, structural interventions, culture and language, and non-discrimination). The Touchstone principles are constitutional in nature in that they are intended to be interpreted by both Aboriginal peoples and social workers within the context of the unique culture of different Aboriginal groups. To be effective, entire systems of child welfare need to engage in the process and embed the principles in all aspects of the work. To date, a number of First Nations and provincial state child welfare authorities in the U.S. and Canada have begun implementing the Touchstone framework, but social work more broadly has done little to embed the Touchstones process in its own work.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Conclusion</p>
                                        <p>So although there has been some marginal progress, the lived experience of Aboriginal children and youth in Canada continues to be predominated by social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression. The significant body of evidence regarding the disproportionate risk faced by Aboriginal children has been inadequate to motivate social workers and social work organizations to implement the many solutions proposed by Aboriginal peoples. Nor has it promoted substantial internal reflection within social work or other helping professions on what our role has been in perpetrating the harm and our consequential responsibility to understand and reconcile the harm. There is a need to affirm and support the traditional ways of helping that have sustained Aboriginal communities for generations.</p>
                                        <p>I look forward to a time when talking about justice for Aboriginal peoples is no longer an unusual or courageous conversation but is instead one that is encouraged and recognized by all Canadians as being important and necessary to affirm our national values of freedom, democracy, justice, and equality; a time when the conversation of reconciliation is just as likely to be initiated by non-Aboriginal people as by Aboriginal people themselves. This will only occur when we as Canadians share what Michael Walzer (1983) describes as a “collective consciousness.” When we can create a common understanding of culture, history, and language through conversation and political action, we can then challenge the inconsistencies in our professional social work values and concepts of justice. This will ensure that democracy, freedom, and equality become the real experience of every Canadian—not just a privileged few standing on one side of a one-way mirror of justice (Blackstock,&#160;2003).</p>
                                        <p>To get there, we must collectively call out the legislation, values, regulations, systems, and actions that perpetuate colonization and its concordant impacts on Aboriginal children and their families, including those harmful and colonial philosophies and practices that are embedded in social work itself. It means understanding the harm from those who experienced it; it means setting aside the instinct to rationalize it or to turn away from it because it is too difficult to hear—or because we feel blamed. It means having conversations about some of the basic values and beliefs that shape our concepts of social work. It means working with, versus working for, Aboriginal peoples. It means understanding that good intentions and conviction are not enough; it is our actions that are most important. It is about embedding the reconciliation process set out in the Touchstones of Hope document throughout the social work profession.</p>
                                        <p>Most of all, it means not standing still—or moving just a little; it means social work taking the long journey of reconciliation. And as we walk and grow tired of the journey, let the images of children like Jordan flash across our consciousness and urge us firmly forward.</p>

                <section class="wrapper--inner grid--full cf">
                    <p>In 1980, the Liberal Party of Canada, led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, resumed office during a period of double-digit inflation and a severe economic recession. The social policy field was dominated by efforts to restrain public expenditure (Guest, 1997: 190). In 1984, the Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, took office. Their cost-containment measures led to a decline in the living standards of low- and moderate-income Canadians. Following the 1980s, advanced capitalist countries such as Canada systematically began to dismantle the welfare state, as responsibiltiy for the well-being of citizens shifted from the community to individuals and families. Much of the social welfare foundation established in Canada after World War II began to unravel.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey text">&ldquo;Starve the Beast&rdquo;/&rdquo;Death by Deficit &ldquo;</p>
                    <p>The rise of what has been coined &ldquo;neo-liberalism&rdquo; characterized this period. Advocates of neo-liberalism supported extensive privatization, fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, and reductions in government spending to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy. Overall, the period from around 1980 to the present has been characterized by greater global economic integration, sweeping cutbacks in social services, and increasingly strong, ideological arguments for greater fiscal restraint.</p>
                    <p>American President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s slogan of the day was to &ldquo;starve the beast&rdquo;&shy;&mdash;meaning the government&mdash;and to provide tax breaks for the wealthy. They would, in turn, reinvest their wealth and grow the economy, or so the argument went. This argument was not lost on Canadian politicians at the time. In Canada, this era was referred to as &ldquo;death by deficit.&rdquo; The economic downturn of 2008&mdash;the fault of corporate greed&mdash;served to encourage still further cutbacks in government spending on health, education, and social welfare.</p>
                    <p>This period saw increasing income inequality, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. In many nations, especially poorer ones, economic restructuring and cutbacks to social programs have been imposed by international agencies, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in the form of so-called &ldquo;structural adjustments.&rdquo; The Canadian government was not immune to these pressures. It reduced its own income security programs to meet the new economic order and to compete with other nations to be &ldquo;investor-friendly.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey text">Less Power to the People</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the impact of globalization on Canada&rsquo;s income security programs was felt mainly by the most disadvantaged members of our society&mdash;people who are impoverished and homeless. They were also the ones who were least able to fight back. Cutbacks and strict eligibility criteria meant that many people were often left without the bare necessities of life. </p>
                    <p>And for the middle class, high-paying jobs were moving offshore to corporate tax havens or export processing zones. Welfare cutbacks meant that ordinary working Canadians might not be able to depend on the traditional social protection offered by such programs as Employment Insurance and Old Age Security.</p>
                    <p>Globalization also meant that national and local governments had less and less freedom to act on behalf of their citizens, especially on the big economic and social questions of the day. The fight to gain and maintain global human rights in the face of economic globalization became, in many respects, the modern epic struggle. And advocacy for equality within and between nations became an integral part of social welfare.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey text"><a href="#" id="page-65" class="ch-link">Changes in Social Work Practice</a></p>
                    <p>Overall, changes in government policy were reflected in changes of emphasis within the social work profession. During this period of cutbacks and restraint, welfare programs became less universal and more targeted toward specific categories of individuals and families. There was increased emphasis on demonstrating quantifiable, measurable results and on justifying every public dollar spent. Scientific management techniques and tighter control of public funding imposed new ways of thinking onto the health professions, including social work, where the client&rsquo;s needs were no longer necessarily at the top of the list. To be sure, some of the efficiency measures were for the better, but the severity of the cutbacks was detrimental to those most in need and resulted in increased pressure on already-overburdened social workers.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey text">Major Influences and Shifts in the Profession</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the aging of the baby boom generation (people born between 1945 and 1965) caused social work to expand and enhance services for older adults. These included services to prevent elder abuse; interventions for people with dementia; palliative care; and services that promote independence for seniors. Trauma treatment expanded from care for military personnel returning from war to care for clients experiencing severe traumatic events that left them feeling depressed and anxious. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) became an increasingly common diagnosis. And finally, new waves of refugees arriving from war zones, such as Syria, presented new challenges and new opportunities for social workers.</p>
                    <p>New technologies such as desktop computers and the Internet were integrated into social work practice in the 1990s, and the impact of technology intensified in the 2000s. Online education and counselling, Telehealth, and practice-based databases increasingly affected how social work was organized and carried out.</p>
                    <p>As another noticeable shift in practice, social workers became increasingly involved in bullying prevention programs throughout Canada. A highly significant turning point in this area took place in the mid-1970s with the work of Dan Olweus. The 1999 Columbine High School&#160;shooting in Colorado, the high-profile suicides of young persons who had been bullied, and increasing reports of cyberbullying caused schools to take notice of this serious issue. Government legislation followed, with the Bullying Act of 2012 in Ontario and Bill 56 in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
                    <p>Anti-oppressive practice became more prevalent in schools of social work. It was well understood that some groups in society were excluded from social resources and had fewer choices than other groups. Women, Indigenous people, youth, older adults, racialized Canadians, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community all possessed a less powerful voice in Canadian society compared to white, male, middle-aged, able-bodied heterosexual individuals. Anti-oppressive practice emphasized social justice, social change, and empowerment through analysis and advocacy at both the macro and micro levels of oppression.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, social work interventions increasingly focused on risk assessments and structured treatment protocols, which were accompanied by the emergence of practice-focused micro- level theories such as systems theory, narrative therapy, and crisis intervention models. More recently, new theoretical practice models such as mindfulness-based interventions and evidence-based practice have emerged. Other trends that affected social work included a greater focus on the field of children&rsquo;s mental health, treatment for gambling, Internet-based social work education, and treatment of substance use disorders .</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Twenty-First Century—What Lies Ahead?</p>
                    <p>In February 2006, Stephen Harper became the twenty-second prime minister of Canada, and the first prime minister representing the “modern” Conservative Party of Canada, which was formed when the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance (the origins of which were in the Reform Party of Canada) joined forces. In 2008, a major economic recession occurred. This global financial crisis has had serious and costly repercussions to this day. What followed was a drastic continuation of the systematic dismantling of social programs. This leaner, meaner approach to social policy changed Canada for the worse, claimed former Saskatchewan premier Roy Romanow, and chipped away at programs that had helped define the compassionate and caring Canada that had evolved over several generations.</p>
                    <p>Romanow, who had headed a royal commission on health care in 2002, predicted that the cuts the Harper Conservative government made would result in a more inequitable nation. Federal health-care spending was reined in, the age of eligibility for Old Age Security was increased by two years, Employment Insurance eligibility criteria were tightened, Indigenous and environmental organizations received less support, and advocacy groups for child care, women’s health, and support for immigrants were all adversely affected. NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair stated that, “Families are getting hit three times at once: they’re getting fewer services, a bigger share of the tax bill, and declining incomes.” In short, Mulcair stated “we’re becoming the first generation in our country’s history to leave our children and grandchildren with a lower quality of life than we inherited from our parents.”</p>
                    <p>In 2015, one in seven people in Canada lived in poverty; 250,000 people were homeless and emergency shelters were at maximum capacity; socio-economic disparities accounted for 20 percent of total annual health-care spending; food bank usage had Increased by 25 percent since the 2008–2009 economic recession; there were only enough child-care spaces for 20 percent of young children; and precarious employment (insecure, unpredictable, low wage, and few benefits) had increased by nearly 50 percent over the last 20 years. And yet, there was still no national poverty plan.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Growing the Middle Class</p>
                    <p>In 2015, Justin Trudeau (the eldest son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau) led the Liberal Party of Canada to a majority government on a platform dedicated to “growing the middle class.” The 2016 federal budget defined a new vision for Canada’s economy: “Canada as a centre of global innovation.” It proposed creating jobs through infrastructure planning, investing in public transit and green infrastructure, and sustaining healthy communities through new clean water and waste-water infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>The budget expanded affordable housing, housing for seniors, and shelter for victims of violence, as well as projects such as the Housing First Initiatives that help homeless Canadians secure stable housing. In addition, $500 million was dedicated to supporting a National Framework on Early Learning and Child Care, of which 20 percent was allocated for Indigenous child care on reserves. Investment in Indigenous Community Infrastructure was a clearly announced priority in the 2016 budget, with a historically high investment of $3.5 billion over five years for green and social infrastructure. The budget appeared to respond to the underlying social determinants of health. Only time will tell whether increasing the deficit will work, and whether these priorities will decrease social and health inequities among Canadians.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Emerging Social Movements: Finding Allies</p>
                    <p>Social workers have an ethical responsibility to advocate for social justice, and many social workers focus on influencing public policy, participating in political action, and organizing group activism. In the first decades of the twenty-first century, many traditionally oppressed groups, whose members are politically astute and adept at using social media, have found a distinct voice and are mobilizing for social change.</p>
                    <p>These modern social movements focus on global and environmental issues, and they collaborate with grassroots organizations to respond to the oppressive political, economic, and social contexts of our daily lives. Rather than simply building coalitions across single issues or lowest-common-denominator politics, these movements are effecting a deepening of interconnected and intersectional analysis that draws strength from each movement and that represents more than the sum of its parts.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Idle No More</p>
                    <p>The Idle No More (INM) movement was initially a series of teach-ins to protest parliamentary bills in Saskatchewan that threatened to erode Indigenous sovereignty environmental protection. The movement quickly became one of the largest Indigenous mass movements in Canadian history—sparking hundreds of rallies and protests across the country. The INM’s vision is to build sovereignty and a resurgence of nationhood, to pressure government and industry to protect the environment, and to build allies in order to reframe the nation-to-nation relationship by highlighting grassroots perspectives, issues, and concerns.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Anti-G20 Mobilization</p>
                    <p>Anti-G20 mobilization in Toronto in 2010 marked a resurgence in coordinated movement organization. The logistics involving the coordination of billets and food and creating infrastructure, including legal support, communications, and medics, was a victory in itself. This mobilization linked global anti-capitalist movements in an era of austerity with local community resistance. It brought multiple vulnerable groups together (people of colour, trans folks, racialized and immigrant people, and Indigenous peoples) to form a grassroots anti-colonial migrant justice group protesting against the indignity of poverty, a lack of inclusive services, repressive immigration policies, and environmental degradation.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">“Leave coal in the hole, leave oil in the soil, leave tar sands in the land”</p>
                    <p>Environmental justice movements are on the upswing in Canada. Many Canadians and Indigenous communities are proclaiming themselves to be ardent environmentalists. Active resistance against the Alberta Tar Sands and the Enbridge Pipeline is ongoing in British Columbia. Localized movements have protested corporate development and environmental degradation. For example, Mohawks in Kanesatake, Québec, rejected a niobium mine; the Okanagan Indian Band in British Columbia staged a blockade against Tolko Industries logging in their watershed; fishers in Prince Edward Island filed a lawsuit against British Petroleum for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that interfered with the northern migration of tuna; the Halalt First Nation blockaded the Chemainus River to protect their aquifers; environmentalists repeatedly opposed the Raven Underground Coal Project in the Comox Valley of British Columbia; Innu communities erected a blockade against New Millennium Capital and Labrador Iron Mines Holdings; and highway developments from Gateway in British Columiba to the Humbolt Highway in Saskatchewan have met with organized resistance.</p>

                    </div>
                </section>
                <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
                    <p> Today there is an unprecedented demand for the skills and knowledge of social workers. And a number of factors are contributing to the challenges social workers and other caring professions will face over the coming years.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">nformation technology. Technology is good, for it enhances our ability to act, but social work is also a hands-on, caring profession where personal interaction is important. Computerized, matter-of-fact solutions to difficult individual problems, in the absence of a caring social worker, can make a bad situation even worse. Moreover, workers will need to be aware of the implications of this technology for client needs as well as client privacy.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Income inequality. Social inequality is on the rise. Upward social mobility for young people in particular is more difficult nowadays. This is causing stress for those in the middle and at the bottom, for many of those new to Canadian society, and for those who need social support services the most.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Demographic changes. Population changes and service demands are rapidly shifting. The population is growing older; common-law and lone-parent families are increasing, as is the proportion of children living in poverty; and immigration is creating cultural shifts.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Economic globalization. Social workers and social activists will increasingly confront the seemingly relentless integration of our world at the global level—economically, politically, and socially. This trend means that national and local governments will enjoy less freedom to act on behalf of their citizens, especially on the big economic and social questions of the day. Thus, local communities and individuals will need to discover new pathways to power.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Immigration and multiculturalism. Canada is one of the most multicultural nations in the world. As Canada continues to welcome people to this country, the difficulties and the excitement associated with new families integrating into Canadian society will continue to dominate the field, changing Canadian society as this process unfolds.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Future Challenges for Social Work Practice</p>
                    <p>It seems likely that social workers, like many professionals, will continue to be expected to do more with less. Likely, they will face greater caseloads and work-related demands. As members of the baby boom generation of social workers retire, future generations will continue to build an understanding of ethical and meaningful practice in the middle of the twenty-first century. This practice will, we hope, differ from the scientific, risk-averse, and accountability-driven social work typical of the late twentieth century. Ideally, government organizations will become more collaborative and Integrated, rather than “stove-piped” (arranged in vertical hierarchies), as was typical of the late twentieth century. Aspects of a newer, more contemporary, and more caring and inclusive practice would include the following:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Relationship building. The focus on accountable and technocratic practice has relegated the relationship-building practices of early social workers to the background. However, as vulnerable people have been oppressed and disenfranchised, their anger, frustration, and powerlessness are often directed at the social workers attempting to engage with and support them. Social workers will need more advanced relationship-building skills to offset the distrust, cynicism, and powerlessness that people we work with may have experienced.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Collaborative practice. Working “with” individuals, families, and communities is increasingly important as social workers recognize their privilege of social location compared to vulnerable people. Listening to, attending to, and empowering clients cannot be practised from a “power over” others stance.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Interdisciplinary practice. Interdisciplinary teams that pool resources (social workers, psychiatrists, substance use counsellors, family-care workers, and so on) can enhance social work practice. Nevertheless, social workers and others will need to be attentive to the potential dangers, perhaps inherent in large-scale practice settings, of a lack of attention to the often specific and complex needs of individuals and families.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Evidence-based practice. There will be pressure for social workers to show measurable results in relation to the interventions they use with their clients. They will need to keep in mind, as will their superiors, that resolving intractable personal and family problems usually takes time and patience and often requires various attempts and creative approaches.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Community-based practice. Indigenous communities are increasingly taking responsibility for a range of social, health, and economic programs within their communities. Policy, programs, and practice can then be adapted to the unique needs and capacities of those communities. Social workers can learn from examples of Indigenous knowledge in action, and mutual learning can replace the imposition of Western world views.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Mobility. Information technologies make geographic boundaries meaningless. International social work, national disaster relief, and critical incidence support (for example, after a school shooting or teen suicides) mean social workers may work outside the province in which they are regulated. To ensure ethical practice, however, regulators must continue to explore cross-jurisdictional and international mobility in relation to regulation.</li>

                    <p>Despite these challenges, it is an exciting time to begin a career in social work. As our country’s 150th anniversary approaches, a new socio-political context is taking shape in Canada. More jobs are predicted, as are more possibilities to provide leadership through change at the macro level. Social workers have been influential in advocating for equality and social justice and in caring for vulnerable and marginalized people for more than a century. They will continue to adapt to and thrive in the new environments in which they find themselves.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Ensuring the highest standards of practice within Canada and internationally</p>
                                        <p>The profession of social work in Canada is regulated by ten provincial associations and one territorial organization, each with its own name, policy, and regulations. Each association is mandated by provincial legislation to regulate and monitor professional social workers and social work practice in their jurisdiction.</p>
                                        <p>Each province has established regulatory bodies (sometimes referred to as Colleges) to govern the profession in accordance with the legislation. Social workers become registered or licensed by becoming members of the regulatory body in the province or territory where they work.</p>
                                        <p>The associations come together under the umbrella of the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW), which provides national leadership in strengthening and advancing the social work profession. The education of social workers is monitored by the national Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE).</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW)</p>
                                        <p>The Canadian Association of Social Workers was founded in 1926 after close to 60 social worker representatives from Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Halifax, and Montréal met and agreed to form a Canadian association. On September 1 of that year, the constitution for the Canadian Association of Social Workers was approved.</p>
                                        <p>At first, social workers joined individually; there were 197 initial members. Today, the CASW is a federated organization with member organizations across the country. The first edition of its professional journal, <span class="CharOverride-2">The Social Worker</span>, appeared in 1932. A simple code of ethics was adopted in 1938 and a significantly revised code was adopted in 1956 (revised or amended in 1963, 1983, 1994, and 2005). The 2005 Code of Ethics is included in an Appendix to this book.</p>
                                        <p>The CASW has jurisdiction over some issues, while the provincial and territorial associations maintain jurisdiction over others. Because social services are primarily a provincial or territorial responsibility in Canada, the provincial associations assume great importance in the development, administration, and day-to-day advocacy of social work. The CASW also assesses foreign social work credentials to evaluate equivalency with Canadian standards; Québec and British Columbia have separate provincial evaluations.</p>
                                        <p>Data on the membership of the CASW is an indication of the rapid growth of the profession: in 1939, CASW had 600 members; by 1966, it had 3,000; and by 1986, there were 9,000 members. Today, there are about 16,000 CASW members across the country, all with some formal credentials in social work.</p>
                                        <p>CASW supplies members with relevant professional documents, a national journal, activities and events, access to benefits, representation nationally and internationally, and an opportunity to participate in professional development panels and organizations.</p>
                                        <p>CASW also influences governments through consultations, position statements, and the presentation of briefs. The main benefit of belonging to the CASW is being part of a group of like-minded people who share the same goals and work together to improve their profession.</p>

                                        <p>The Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (CASSW) was established in 1967, replacing the National Committee of Schools of Social Work, which, since 1948, had been the forum for professional education in social work.</p>
                                        <p>Since 2008, CASSW has been called the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE). CASWE is a national association of university faculties, schools, and departments offering social work education at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels. There is no association representing college-level social service work education.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of the CASWE is to advance the standards, effectiveness, and relevance of social work education and scholarship. CASWE is responsible for reviewing and approving social work education programs. It also publishes a quarterly journal, the Canadian Social Work Review, and undertakes research relevant to the profession.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW)</p>
                                        <p>The International Federation of Social Workers is a successor to the International Permanent Secretariat of Social Workers, founded in Paris in 1928. In 1950, the IFSW was created, with the goal of becoming an international organization of professional social workers. The IFSW represents over half a million social workers in 55 countries. The IFSW promotes social work as a profession, links social workers around the world, and promotes social policy and planning at the national and international levels.</p>
                                        <p>The International Association of Schools of Social Work is an association of educators and institutions involved in social work education worldwide. The IASSW adheres to all UN Declarations and Conventions on human rights, while recognizing that respect for the inalienable rights of the individual is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace.</p>

                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p>During my years of social work practice, I worked primarily with children and adolescents, as well as with their parents, their immediate and extended families, and their social networks, both one-on-one and in small groups. Currently, I teach courses in methods of individual intervention and preparatory intervention courses for student field placements. I also run seminars for students during their placements to facilitate the integration of theory and practice. From time to time, I offer preliminary and advanced training for supervisors in the field to help them prepare for student placements. From 2008 to 2011, I was responsible for the coordination of the field program, as well as all activities surrounding field work, including the development of educational tools to support supervisors and students.</p>
                            <p>Having worked with children, youth, and families in schools and in child protection for more than 15 years, my main research interests concern the social and individual adaptation of children and youth, the parent&ndash;child attachment, families in social distress, social exclusion, and the trajectory of youth marginalization through the child welfare system. During my doctoral studies, I completed a research project involving both quantitative and qualitative methods with youth who were placed in care until they reached adulthood. Since then, I have included both types of research methods in my training of masters&rsquo; degree students at our university and in my own research.</p>
                            <p>Currently I am the principal investigator on a joint France&ndash;Qu&eacute;bec research project. Five social work training institutes in the region of Paris are measuring the impact of the new public management and core competency practice requirements on professional social workers. This research aims to analyze the impact of social work reforms and the introduction of core competencies and practice behaviours on the professionalization of social workers in three generational groups (under 30 years old, 31 to 50 years old, and over 50 years old) to determine whether there is a difference in the practice of social workers trained before or after the introduction of core competencies and to analyze whether the new public management approach changes professional practices.</p>
                            <p>I am also interested in the emergence of new social work practices based on evidence and on community initiatives. For example, in partnership with several community organizations, I am working on a research project to develop alternative means of prescribing medication for people with a diagnosis</p>
                            <p> of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the Saguenay&ndash;Lac-St-Jean region. This collaborative research aims to better understand the problem of ADHD; to draw a picture of the current situation in the Saguenay&ndash;Lac-Saint-Jean region; to improve knowledge of the overall vision, best practices, and alternative means to the use of medication; and to document the most appropriate alternative to addressing the multiple challenges of ADD/ADHD.</p>
                            <p>In addition, I work with the Addiction Rehabilitation Centre (Centre de r&eacute;adaptation en d&eacute;pendance) in Jonqui&egrave;re, Qu&eacute;bec to evaluate the effectiveness of the opioid substitution program. The project focuses on an evaluation of the current program, designed to reduce the consumption of opioids by using methadone. Our research aims to analyze the effectiveness of the services offered to meet the needs of service users; to examine the short-term and long-term impacts of the program, along with their sustainability and relevance with respect to the initial goals of the program; to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the impact of the intervention methods; and, finally, to compare the program with other programs worldwide and to offer recommendations that will help improve program effectiveness.</p>
                            <p>I have been involved with the Canadian Association for Social Work Education since 2004, first as executive director for three years, during which time I had the pleasure of managing the main activities of the association, including three annual conferences on various topics affecting the advancement of social work in Canada. Since 2011, I have been an evaluator and the francophone vice-president of the Commission for Accreditation, which oversees the accreditation of bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degree programs in social work for the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE), representing the 42 schools of social work in Canada.</p>
