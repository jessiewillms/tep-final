As a result, social work is increasingly able to embrace fluid notions of identity while drawing on more inclusive ideas about what is normal or healthy in terms of gender expression and sexual desire. This shift is a work in progress, requiring professionals to question heteronormativity, cisnormativity, and our own conceptualizations about sexual and gender identities and practices.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">In 1892, American doctor James Kiernan was the first to use the term “heterosexual.” He used the term in a scholarly article to describe people who were seen as deviant because they had sex primarily for pleasure, not procreation, and were erotically attracted to people of both sexes.</p>
                            <p class="text--caption">Kiernan’s article was also the first North American publication to use the term “homosexual,” which described persons whom we would now think of as transgendered—people who bend or cross conventional gender roles (Katz, 1995).</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-374" class="ch-link"></a>Two major historical developments over the past 50 years have helped to shape our thinking about gender and sexuality. The first is <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">sexology,</span> a field of study that attempted to classify sexual desire and gender identity. The second is community activism&mdash;a creative and focused movement that evolved in response to a history of oppression and marginalization shared by persons embracing sexual and gender diversity. Community activism has led to growing recognition of sexual and gender rights in Canada.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Sexology Influences Perceptions of Human Sexuality</p>
                        <p>In the late nineteenth century, scientists and philosophers in Europe and North America increasingly applied notions of science and formal reason to explain and categorize the world around them. Part of that process of categorization involved documenting what was considered to be proper sexual attraction (Katz , 1995: 51). Thus, the science of sex&mdash;sexology&mdash;was invented, and the ideas of the &ldquo;heterosexual&rdquo; and the &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo; emerged. This is not to say that same-sex and different-sex desire did not exist before this time, but the turn of the century marked a shift in how people made sense of these desires and behaviours.</p>
                        <p>One aspect of the study of sexual identities that occurred at the turn of the century is often termed &rdquo;medical colonization.&rdquo; The end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century was a time when medical authority began to replace pre-existing religious and judicial authorities. Prior to this transition, sexual and gender non-conventionality were most often understood as sinful or illegal. With the rise of professional &ldquo;scientific medicine,&rdquo; sexologists were called into courtrooms to provide evidence that such transgressions were caused by biological or neurological abnormalities that required treatment, rather than punishment.</p>
                        <p>By 1900, much of the concern around sexual normality and abnormality was focused on whether people were engaging in sex primarily for reproduction (normal) or pleasure (deviant). One of the pioneers in creating categories of normal and abnormal behaviour was Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840&ndash;1902). Krafft-Ebing&rsquo;s most famous piece of writing is a categorization of abnormal sexual behaviour entitled Psychopathia Sexualis. It is in Krafft-Ebing&rsquo;s work that the heterosexual begins to represent normality&mdash;Krafft-Ebing implicitly defined heterosexuality as reproductive sex between a man and a woman, and homosexuality as same-sex desire.</p>
                        <p>While some researchers were investigating the heterosexual, others were developing scientific theories of homosexuality. One of the first to do so was Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (1825&ndash;1895), a German lawyer who was vocal in the fight to decriminalize sodomy (anal sex). Ulrichs created categories of the Urning (a female caught in a male body) and Urningin (a male caught in a female body) to make sense of same-sex attraction. He viewed homosexuality as inborn and natural. Ulrichs was also one of the pioneers of the gay and lesbian rights movement.</p>
                        <p>In their efforts to provide ever-finer classifications of sexual differences, researchers sought physical markers. It was argued that one could determine a homosexual by the way he walked, the size of his hips, the shape of his penis, or his &ldquo;womanly&rdquo; behaviour. Female homosexuality was seldom explored scientifically until the end of the nineteenth century. Sexologists largely considered female homosexuality in relation to &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; or enlarged clitorises, hermaphroditism, and gender-reversed body types. By the 1920s, lesbianism was linked with &ldquo;inappropriate female behaviour,&rdquo; such as political activism or avoidance of motherhood. Many of the beliefs of early sexologists continue to influence common thinking about sexuality.</p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#" id="page-375" class="ch-link"></a>In the years following this early exploration of gender and sexual identity, a second generation of sexologists emerged. One of the most well known scientists of this generation was Alfred Kinsey (1894&ndash;1956). <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">The Kinsey Report,</span> published in 1948 under the title Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, surveyed a wide variety of people and their sexual habits and surprised the American public by revealing that 37 percent of the men in Kinsey&rsquo;s survey reported having had a homosexual experience to the point of orgasm. Most significantly, he showed that people&rsquo;s sexual behaviours combined so-called perverse behaviours with those considered normal. In 1953, he published a second report, titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.</p>
                        <p>Kinsey&rsquo;s research was groundbreaking because it suggested that everyday sexual behaviour often transgressed laws, public opinion, and social norms. However, with the rise of Cold War anti-communism in the 1950s, Kinsey&rsquo;s work was viewed with suspicion. Rumours spread that he was a communist, working to destroy American values. He lost his research funding and died of a heart attack in 1956. But Kinsey&rsquo;s research provided much of the basis for the political analysis developed by members of the gay liberation movement in the early 1970s.</p>
                        <p>The second generation of sexologists suggested that our social world plays a significant role in shaping our sexual desires and behaviours, and it also challenged <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-3">heterosexism.</span> This change in our understanding of sexuality was, in itself, a result of social and political changes. For example, second-generation sexologists were influenced by the feminist movement, which challenged the notion of a woman&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural&rdquo; place in society, suggesting that the &ldquo;female&rdquo; gender role is defined as much by social expectations as by any innate characteristics.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-376" class="ch-link"></a>The following summaries of some modern Western responses to sexual diversity highlight a shift in theoretical understandings of human sexuality. Each of these theories attempts to solve the puzzle of sexuality, but none has been able to explain fully the complex and multiple ways in which we constitute our gender identities, sexual desires, and sexual practices, or how these identities, desires, and practices vary according to historical and cultural contexts.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey" id="kc-4">Biological Determinism</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Early sexologists attempted to explain sexuality in terms of biology. These explanations are known as <span class="span--keyword text--red">biological determinism,</span> which has traditionally focused on the organic causes of non-conventional gender and sexual identities and behaviours. This theoretical approach is still used today. Recently, Simon LeVay, former Harvard University researcher and founder of the Institute of Gay and Lesbian Education, argued that the brain structures of gay men differ from those of heterosexual men. We have also witnessed the search for the &ldquo;gay gene.&rdquo; Such theories have been used to demand rights for queer communities on the grounds that queer persons are born queer and that their sexuality is not a matter of choice.</p>
                        <p>While it has a certain potential for liberation, biological determinism also has serious limitations. First, the argument that sexual diversity and gender identity are rooted in biology has not ended homophobia, heterosexism, and cissexualism. In fact, biological determinism has often been used to entrench inequality. Second, scientific &ldquo;truths&rdquo; related to gender and sexuality have consistently been shown to reflect current socio-political norms and values. The search for clear, identifiable differences regarding gender and sexuality also raises ethical concerns. For example, what if prospective parents want to test their fetus for the &ldquo;gay gene&rdquo; and choose abortion based on the result? This line of reasoning also accentuates the differences that heterosexual privilege relies upon, rather than exploring the similarities shared by people who desire those of a different sex and those who desire those of the same sex.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Social Constructionism</span></p>
                        <p>Another group of theories related to sexuality is known as <span class="span--keyword text--red">social constructionism.</span> These are predominantly the theories advanced by the second generation of sexologists. According to this perspective, sexualities are constructed by our social and cultural context and also by our cultural history. It is as a result of such theories that gender reassignment surgery at birth was introduced for babies determined to be intersexuals&mdash;persons whose sexual organs are not clearly male or female. It is also on the basis of such theories that psychotherapeutic approaches to &ldquo;curing&rdquo; sexual orientation (if an individual is attracted to people of the same sex) or reversing gender identity (if it is inconsistent with an individual&rsquo;s sex) evolved.</p>
                        <p>While it is clear that society does play a large role in our sexual and gender expression, social constructivist theory has a number of shortcomings. First, research has found that people cannot change their sexual orientation. While some individuals can decide not to act on their desires, the desires themselves do not disappear. Equally, babies who have been reassigned a gender at birth, either as a result of a botched circumcision or the development of ambiguous genitalia, have not easily reinvented themselves as the gendered subjects that doctors have chosen for them. Many face challenges once they enter puberty and find that their gender identity is incompatible with their sex. It seems clear that our sex, gender expression, and sexual orientation rely upon at least some biological factors.</p>

                                <p class="text--caption">Freud’s theories about sexuality marked an important shift away from biology to psychology, but his approach, as adopted by psychologists, was not necessarily liberating for gay men and lesbians. More often, Freud’s theories were mobilized to further pathologize homosexuality as a mental illness that needed to be “cured.”</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-378" class="ch-link"></a>One significant theory that has emerged in the past 20 years or so to explain sexuality and gender falls largely within the social constructionist school of thought&mdash;<span class="span--keyword text--red">Queer theory.</span> This body of thought raises doubts about the feasibility of legislative changes within a capitalist democracy to bring about liberation for marginalized groups. Indeed, these theorists argue for a radical transformation of societal norms and expectations related to human sexuality.</p>
                        <p>By the late 1980s, people had begun to see the many ways in which women, people of colour, and members of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">LGBTQ+</span> communities were still marginalized, discriminated against, and oppressed, despite hard-won legislative protection. Such observations led some activists to conclude that the existing social structures of Western society, while offering many benefits, also generate some fundamental problems that limit the possibility for freedom, equality, and justice for all.</p>
                        <p>Queer activists and theorists argue for a rethinking of the entire terrain within which we create categories of people and distribute power among them. In part, Queer theory responds to the realization that many people do not fit easily or neatly into the binary oppositions of man&ndash;woman, heterosexual&ndash;homosexual, and so on. Queer theorists suggest that identifying as gay or straight does not provide an unquestionable or complete description of who people are sexually attracted to, with whom they have sex, or with whom they share loving relationships.</p>

                                <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-8">Sex and gender</span> refer to quite different aspects of our identities. Sex (usually male or female) is what doctors attribute to babies based largely on the shape and size of their genitalia. In fact, sex is determined by genetics, chromosomes, and hormones, which can combine to create an indeterminate number of sexes. Gender has two components: gender identity, which is the sense we have of ourselves as male, female, or transgendered; and gender role, which is our adherence to cultural norms of femininity and masculinity.
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-9">Sexual orientation</span> is an emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectional attraction to another person. It is not dependent upon a person’s gender identity or gender role.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-10">Two-spirited</span> is a First Nations terms that recognizes gender as a continuum and includes sexual or gender identity, sexual orientation, and social values.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-11">Cissexual/Cisgender</span> are terms used to define persons who are not transsexuals and who have only ever experienced their gender identity and physical sex as being aligned. The term “cisgender” is used to de-privilege those who consider themselves as having a “normal” gender expression and to validate an understanding of transgender identities as simply variants of gender expression. Cissexism refers to the belief that transsexuals’ identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than, those of cissexuals.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-12">Transgender</span> includes those who identify as bigender, gender benders, gender outlaws, cross-dressers, drag queens, drag kings, transvestites, and transsexuals. Some intersexuals also identify as transgender. Some transgendered persons understand their experience in dimorphic absolutes (e.g., a male trapped in a female body), while others inhabit a zone “between” the sexes.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-13">Transsexuals</span> are individuals whose gender identity is at odds with their physical sex. Some transsexuals undergo gender reassignment surgery to make their anatomy coincide with their gender. Others use hormones to reshape their body. Not everyone who identifies as transsexual uses medical interventions to change their physical appearance.Transsexualism is classified under “Gender Identity Disorders” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-14">Intersexuals</span> are individuals whose external sex or genitalia are indeterminate. These are people who appear to be males but are biologically females, people with female physical attributes who are biologically males, and people who have the external appearance of both sexes as well as the DNA chromosome karyotypes of both sexes.</p>
                                    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-15">Homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia</span> describe an individual’s and/or society’s fear and hatred of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered persons.

                            <a href="#" id="page-379" class="ch-link"></a>In the 1950s, before the rise of the new understandings described in the earlier sections of this chapter, the psychiatric profession officially labelled homosexuality as a mental disorder. The profession&rsquo;s response to such perceived deviance included administering drugs to people, performing lobotomies, and subjecting gay men and lesbians to electroshock treatment. Some lesbians endured hysterectomies and estrogen injections (Warner, 2002: 24). Early gay and lesbian community activists challenged medical authority, and homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association in 1973.</p>
                        <p>The emergence of gay communities in Canada can be traced back to at least World War II. During this time, the traditional patriarchal family structure was disrupted to some extent. There were increasing opportunities for people to socialize in predominantly same-sex groups, since men were in the army and at war, while many women were working together in large factories. Many people moved to cities, where anonymity and lack of parental supervision allowed more opportunities for sexual exploration. This freedom was circumscribed, however, by the hunt for &ldquo;subversives&rdquo; that characterized the Cold War in the 1950s. Any kind of deviance became suspect, because the logic of the day was that if you had anything to hide (and same-sex attraction was considered something to hide), then you were more likely to be blackmailed into working for a foreign government (Girard, 1987).</p>
                        <p>Thus, the 1950s were a terrible time for gay men and lesbians, especially in the Canadian civil service. The RCMP collected close to 9,000 names of people within the service who were suspected of being homosexual (Kinsman, 2003). Many of these people were subjected to police interrogation and surveillance. It was within this climate that in 1952, homosexuals were prohibited from entering Canada under the Immigration Act. While the next few decades brought an easing of anxieties over communism, it would not be until 1976, after significant activism, that the provision denying entrance to homosexuals was removed from the act.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, a growing gay and lesbian political movement began to shape public discourse and scientific understandings about sexuality. This movement symbolically coalesced on June 27 and 28, 1969, when a series of riots erupted in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a New York City gay bar. The riots, which were later called the <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-16">Stonewall Rebellion,</span> marked the beginning of a more public, large-scale movement for gay and lesbian rights. A new national organization, the Gay Liberation Front (GLF), was formed with the mandate to create freedom for all oppressed people, not just members of LGBTQ+ communities. Prominent transgender activists at the time, such as Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, who subsequently co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (S.T.A.R.), were also involved in clashes with police during the Stonewall riots.</p>
                        <p>Gay and lesbian organizations worked systematically to challenge laws limiting the civil and social rights of members of LGBTQ+ communities. An important year for the recognition of the civil rights of gays, lesbians, and bisexual persons in Canada was 1969. With the passing of Bill C-150 and then-justice minister Pierre Trudeau&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;there is no place for the State in the bedrooms of the nation,&rdquo; gross indecency and buggery (the legal terms used to describe gay sex) were decriminalized as long as these acts were committed in private between two consenting adults over the age of 21. Since then, there have been a number of changes to the Criminal Code (see the feature on &ldquo;Same-Sex Rights in Canada: A Timeline and&#8239;Highlights&rdquo;).</p>

                        <p>As gay and lesbian activism became more prominent in the 1990s, queer activism popularized the term &ldquo;queer&rdquo; to be more inclusive of sexual minorities and other marginalized people. &ldquo;By adopting &lsquo;queer&rsquo; they reclaimed and politicized a derogatory term commonly used before gay and lesbian liberation. It represented the belief in an identity that is more ambiguous and more fluid than gay, lesbian, or homosexual&rdquo; (Warner, 2002: 262).</p>
                        <p>Queer activists distanced themselves from gay and lesbian organizers by critiquing identity-based movements.

                       <p>The bill passes on April 11, 2000, with the definition of “marriage” remaining as is (“the lawful union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others”), but the definition of “common-law relationship” expanded to include same-sex couples.</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-384" class="ch-link"></a>In the past few decades, there has been a complete revamping of the legislative framework that excluded and punished homosexuality in Canada. Also, significant legislative changes have been made in order to actively include gay men and lesbians in mainstream society.</p>

<p>Until the early 1990s, gays, lesbians ,and bisexual persons were not allowed to serve in the Canadian military. In 1992, the federal courts lifted this ban, and with this ruling, the legislative barriers to LGBTQ+ persons joining the armed forces were removed. Nevertheless, LGBTQ+ persons have continued to raise concerns about the treatment they receive in the military. Changing the culture of the armed forces to become queer-positive has been a tremendous challenge that continues today.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, a significant change occurred in the area of spousal benefits. In 1999, an act regulating survivor benefits, known as the Public Service Superannuation Act, was amended to extend such benefits to same-sex couples. The most comprehensive package of changes for people living in same-sex relationships came with Bill C-23, the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act. This bill amended 68 federal statutes to provide everyone in common-law relationships with nearly all the rights and responsibilities ascribed to heterosexual married couples.</p>

<p>In 1980, federal Member of Parliament Pat Carney first attempted to have sexual orientation included in the Human Rights Act, but the bill did not pass. While other attempts were made in the intervening years, it was not until 1996 that discrimination based on sexual orientation was officially added to the act.</p>

<p>During this period, major legal battles were also fought to challenge Canada&rsquo;s obscenity legislation, which allowed Canada Customs to confiscate gay literature, including safer sex material depicting anal sex. In December 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that Canada Customs was discriminatory against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered materials, and placed the burden on the Crown to prove obscenity as opposed to requiring community bookstores or other importers to defend against the charge. Gay rights activists claimed a victory.</p>

<p>In February 2001, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was reformed so that same-sex partners can be recognized as members of the family class of immigrants. Now, a common-law partner is anyone who has been in a conjugal relationship for at least one year. Refugee processes also now recognize that people have legitimate refugee claims if they fear persecution in their country of origin due to their sexual orientation.</p>

<p>The battle over gay marriage in Canada was particularly intense, with some religious groups suggesting that the legalization of gay marriage would violate their religious freedom. However, in 2005, Canada enacted federal legislation providing for marriage for same-sex partners.</p>

<p>Transgendered and transsexual persons have also faced significant barriers to acknowledgement of their rights. Not every trans person wants gender-confirming surgeries, but for those who do, the surgeries are considered essential. After sustained battles, eight provinces (all but New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) now fund some combination of gender-confirming surgeries (GCS). In a 2013 CBC radio documentary about the challenges faced by trans people waiting for GCS, freelance reporter Maggie Rahr stated that those on the lengthy surgical wait lists were &ldquo;statistically at a higher risk of suicide than any other known population.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-385" class="ch-link"></a>In March 2013, the House of Commons passed Bill C-279 to include the rights of trans persons in the Canadian Human Rights Code. However, the bill has faced significant opposition in the Senate and remains in limbo at the time of the writing of this chapter.</p>

<p>Legislation that shows honour and respect for same-sex relationships has had little impact on the lives of transsexual people. Discrimination against transgendered and transsexual people is, even today, not explicitly illegal under the same human rights laws that formally recognize the human rights of gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons.</p>

<p>In the late 1990s, educational institutions began to face the problem of the bullying and subsequent suicides of LGBTQ+ youth in their schools and thus initiated sensitivity training for staff and students. Positive changes resulted from the activism of student-led, school-based gay&ndash;straight alliances (GSAs). This movement started in the United States, and the Canadian version (known as &ldquo;Day of Pink&rdquo;) evolved when a teen was bullied with homophobic slurs for wearing a pink t-shirt. By the mid-2000s, GSAs had spread across Canada, and in 2006 the Canadian Teachers&rsquo; Federation distributed a handbook on how to develop GSAs. While the courts and legislative changes have been proactive in ensuring that GSAs are allowed in every school, GSAs have been less successfully implemented in private and Catholic school settings.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Emerging Concepts of Sexual and Gender Diversity</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-386" class="ch-link"></a>As we learn more about the broad range of sexual behaviours, desires, and identities, it has become increasingly clear that social workers must be aware of and open to the complex and varied roles that sexual practices and communities play in our society. As societal understanding of sexual behaviour shifts, social workers must reflect on their own beliefs and values around sexuality and determine how they can work effectively with people whose experiences may be either quite different from, or very similar to, their own.</p>

<p>It is important to consider how to communicate acceptance when unexpected disclosures happen and how to create a sex-positive atmosphere in one&rsquo;s work so that clients can feel safe when discussing their sexuality or gender if it is relevant to the challenges they are facing.</p>

        <h3 class="text--smaller text--bold text--bold-purple">Gender-Fluid Children</h3>
        <p class="text--caption">Our society has taught us that there are only two genders—male and female—but this is not the case. Not all people fit neatly into a male or female gender identity. This may be particularly confusing for children who best describe their reality as having the sense of being “both” or “neither.” Some of these children may speak of being more male on some days and more female on other days; in other words, they see themselves as “gender fluid.”</p>
        <p class="text--caption">These are all normal variations in human gender and do not mean something is wrong with a child. A child’s gender is not what others tell them, but who they know themselves to be. Parents of gender-fluid children can be supportive by accepting their children for who they are.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Non-monogamy/Polyamoury</p>

<p>As the social work profession rethinks how it situates itself in relation to supporting healthy sexuality and healthy relationships, many workers have also had to grapple with our culture&rsquo;s deep investment in normative practices of heterosexual monogamy. Increasingly, non-monogamous and polyamorous communities and individuals are defending the moral and legal aspects of their relationships, viewed as contentious by many Canadians. Some observers view institutionalized non-monogamy in the form of polygamy as harmful to women, children, society, and the institution of marriage. At the same time, some female polygamists, female polyamourists, and female researchers question the ways in which we attribute harm to certain forms of non-monogamy such as polygamy, but not to others such as adultery (Rambukkana, 2015). While the impact of these debates on social work has been limited to this point, non-monogamous lifestyles are likely to continue to unsettle some of our ideas about sexual, romantic, and/or institutionalized relationships.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Asexuality</p>

<p>Another community that is challenging taken-for-granted norms related to sexuality is the one percent of our population who identify as asexual (Bogaert, 2004). This group challenges society to reflect on the fact that we define our most significant relationships as those that are romantic and sexual, and how by doing so, we can marginalize those people who are single and asexual (as either a life-long or a temporary identity). For social workers, especially those in the field of mental wellness, these are important considerations, as they question our notion that people must be romantically or sexually paired to be healthy and happy. Again, this emerging area of sexuality is one that social workers need to keep in mind when working with clients.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Kink</p>

<p>The kink community includes people who are interested in a wide range of kinky sex, including, but not limited to, bondage, sado-masochism, and leather, all of which involve manifestations of dominance and submission through consensual role-playing in a sexual context. While recent decades have seen social workers shift their perceptions of LGBTQ+ people and their sexual and gender practices, there has been less of a movement to understand and accept what are called &ldquo;paraphilias&rdquo; (Nichols, 2006). Kinky activities may be unusual, but they are generally safe and consensual. Kink communities have well-established codes of behaviour stating that all participants be fully informed, capable of consent, and free to avoid activities that incur medical or mental danger. There is no evidence that people who engage in kinky sex are any more or less healthy than people who do not. However, people who participate in kink communities sometimes struggle with internalized or external stigma.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Sexual Trauma</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-387" class="ch-link"></a>A significant amount of social work is focused on working with people who are victims or perpetrators of sexual violence (or both). Rates of sexual trauma and sexual harm are high in this country, which means that social workers are likely to come into contact with people who have experienced and/or perpetrated sexual trauma. When working with such clients, whether they are gay, straight, or trans, it is crucial that social workers reflect on their own experiences of sexual trauma, if any have occurred, as well as their own feelings around such issues.</p>

<p>Family members commit half of all reported sexual abuse. This type of abuse is also the most harmful because it involves a significant violation of a trusting relationship. Friends, colleagues, and, less frequently, strangers can also perpetrate sexual violence.</p>

<p>Working with survivors of sexual abuse often involves helping people to cope with stigma and shame and to rebuild a sense of security and dignity. Some social workers support survivors by accompanying them through the medical system and/or the legal process of laying charges and going to court. This can be a particularly painful process for survivors. Most often, survivors of sexual trauma need an opportunity to speak openly about their feelings in order to deal with the effects of the trauma. Social workers play a vital role in ensuring that victims of sexual trauma have a say in decision-making processes and in what their healing will look like.</p>

<p>Intimate partner violence and sexual assault are also of concern in the LGBTQ+ community, partly because such incidents are often hidden and denied. In the practitioner profile for this chapter, for example, Ottawa social worker Dillon Black observes that intimate partner violence and gender-based violence have been occurring for many years within the queer community of which they are a member. It has been cloaked in silence and shame, however, and non-disclosure has made it difficult for social workers to reach out to help survivors of violence within the LGBTQ+ community. Dillon sees an urgent need to talk openly about this problem.</p>

        <h3 class="text--smaller text--bold text--purple">Sexuality, Aging, and Disability</h3>
        <p class="text--caption">Until recently, society has imagined that people who are elderly or who have physical, psychiatric, or intellectual disabilities are non-sexual beings. In recent decades, these beliefs have been challenged. Increasingly, social workers are becoming more aware that many older people and people with disabilities are sexual beings and may be sexually active. Older people, as a group, enjoy the full spectrum of sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identities. Social workers need to be well versed in how to support older people and people with disabilities in enjoying their sex lives. They can help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and also ensure that vulnerable persons who wish to be sexually active are protected from victimization.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Sexual Offences</p>

<p>Social workers also work with people who commit sexual offences. Increasingly, the goal of this work is to encourage potential perpetrators to seek treatment before committing a crime. This requires that, as a society and as a profession, we communicate respect and value for people who have sexual fantasies that include harming others, while being clear that such acts are unacceptable. Preventative programs are becoming more prevalent across North America and Europe, and there are signs that early interventions, accompanied by ongoing support, can be very effective. While social work has taken a clear and important position that it is not possible or ethical to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; people&rsquo;s sexual desires, certain forensic programs have been quite successful in working with clients to increase their own understanding of their harmful sexual desires and to work effectively to reduce their risk of re-offending. These programs help people to see how sex with consent is better sex, and teach clients skills to increase the likelihood of having relationships in which they can enjoy consensual sex. The programs help clients to understand what triggers them to want non-consensual sex and how to avoid and/or manage these triggers.</p>

<p>Canada has been a pioneer in the establishment of Circles of Support and Accountability programs, in which citizen volunteers support convicted sexual offenders upon release from prison in order for them to avoid re-offending. Studies have found that without treatment, rates of recidivism for sexual offences are between 13 and 17 percent, but with treatment, this figure falls closer to 2 or 3 percent (Federoff and Moran, 1997).</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Gender, for many North American and European kids, is no longer seen as a fixed and immutable quality</p>

                        <p>Summer camp began last month for my oldest child with a sit-down during which the campers took turns declaring their pronouns. Most of the teenagers chose to be known by “he” or “she,” generally but not always in ways that coincided with their physical appearance. There were a handful of “theys,” and one “it.”</p>

                        <p>This new camp ritual was not viewed by any of the teenagers I met there as controversial or weird; nor were the pronoun choices (though some of the more exotic ones, especially the plurals, fell by the wayside). Gender, for a good many middle-class North American and European kids, is no longer seen as a fixed and immutable quality.</p>

                        <p>This has taken many people by surprise. The movement to recognize people with changed or changing gender identities has been the fastest-emerging social movement of our age. Almost overnight, terms such as “cisgendered” (the name for those of us whose gender coincides with our physical sex) have leaped from the fringes of activism to mainstream</p>

                        <p>vocabulary. The concept of “trans rights” is now part of government and corporate policy discussions.</p>

                        <p>In part, it is propelled by the very public gender changes of people such as Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner and Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning, or such public moves as the appointment of Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, a transgender woman, to the White House staff by U.S. President Barack Obama [in 2015]—but also by a dawning understanding that a number of people among us are more comfortable living under a different pronoun.</p>

                        <p>As successful as this movement has been, it has confused some otherwise liberal-minded people: Is this a movement to bring “trans” people out of the closet, to celebrate gender as a fluid matter of choice and will? Or is it to allow people to live within the “right” gender for them, not necessarily the one they were born with? Much of this confusion is rooted in two very different, and sometimes conflicting, ways of understanding gender.<</p>

                        <p>For those who grew up admiring such well-known transgender figures as the synthesizer composer Wendy Carlos, once known as Walter Carlos; the travel writer Jan Morris, who until 1964 was James Morris; or the great economist Deirdre McCloskey, once known as Donald McCloskey, their former gender was a biographical curiosity and their current one an insignificant aspect of their personalities.</p>

                        <p>And for the vast majority, that invisibility is what is sought. “Put simply, our goal is to blend into the background and go about our lives unnoticed,” the transgender activist Katie Glover wrote this week. “The less interesting we are, the better our lives become.”</p>

                        <p>But another chain of thought has taken root. In 1993, the biol-ogist Anne Fausto-Sterling created a stir with her essay “The Five Sexes,” which argued that a large proportion of people—one in 25, she cited—were born without clearly male or female sexual characteristics, and were surgically or psychologically “adjusted” to fit a male or female pattern. That number was later revised far downward by its author and others, to four in 1,000 or fewer, but the essay became, and remains, influential—as does her initial argument that gender should be non-binary and provisional.</p>

                        <p>That combined with the argument, also gaining traction in the 1990s, that gender is a purely “performative” act, a societally determined costume play without biological basis. “One is not born a woman, one becomes one,” Simone de Beauvoir famously wrote, and writers such as Judith Butler made that claim near-universal by arguing that gender was an artifice imposed from without; that nothing was innate.</p>

                        <p>That is certainly true at some level—much of what we call “femininity,” for example, was a way of acting that only became popular during an era of female servility. But there is, most agree, a level at which gender—our understanding of our sexual role—does have at least some biological basis.</p>

                        <p>Our bodies and brains both start out female, in the womb; testosterone then sets off a masculization process in the genitals and brains of males, through different processes—but it doesn’t always happen for everyone. It therefore is not uncommon, the neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp has shown, to have “female-type brains in male-type bodies…or male-type brains in female-type bodies.”</p>

                        <p>Gender, then, is not necessarily a lifestyle choice: ambiguous or “wrong” gender can be as physical and real as anything in your body. We should support people in righting such wrongs, however they arose, so that their gender can go back to being, for everyone out of adolescence, part of our background noise.</p>

                                                <h3>Two Important Points for Discussion</h3>
                                                <p>In general, the trans community discourages references to trans persons’ earlier identities, such as the several references made in Saunders’s article. Some people wish to leave behind them a previous self that they feel was inauthentic.</p>
                                                <p>Additionally, concerns are emerging about how social work is responding to trans children. There are two competing narratives: “gender fluidity” versus “right brain in wrong body.” The latter is gaining dominance, and professionals are moving more quickly to transform children into their “right” gender. There is some justification for this, but the hormonal and surgical changes are irreversible and are based on the belief that the child’s gender, once transformed, will be stable for decades to come&#173;—for which the evidence is not conclusive.</p>
                                                <p>Some observers are raising concerns that in a decade or so, we may find that some children’s gender identity was not as fluid as was assumed when their bodies were chemically and surgically altered. The number of trans students presenting themselves in the school system has so startlingly exceeded previous statistics on the rate of transgenderism that some experts are beginning to question the prevalence of the “right brain in wrong body” narrative. It is not clear at present which narrative will eventually prove stronger in terms of validity.</p>

                        <a href="#" id="page-390" class="ch-link"></a>In 1999, Carol-Anne O&rsquo;Brien highlighted the ways in which social work may be implicated in the pathologization of gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities. She found that social workers can sometimes promote the belief that homosexuality is a phase that some people pass through. She concluded that the most common way in which social workers reinforce heteronormativity&mdash;the &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo; of heterosexuality&mdash;is through silence about non-heterosexual identities. This reinforcement of heteronormativity is exacerbated by the relatively few numbers of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, or transsexual role models in the profession.</p>
                    <p>There are two extremes in social work counselling involving lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered or transsexual persons, and gay men. The first occurs when social workers exaggerate the difficulties of living in a heterosexist society and obscure the fact that LGBTQ+ persons are often happy and healthy and enjoy positive relationships with family members, straight colleagues, and friends. The second occurs when social workers assume that sexual orientation and gender identity make no difference to a person&rsquo;s experience, attitudes, or behaviour. The challenge is to find a middle path between these two extremes in order to provide balanced support to members of queer communities (van Wormer et al., 2000).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Challenging Heterosexist Norms</p>
                    <p>There has been a long history of people in social work who have challenged the heterosexist norms of our society. Gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered and transsexual persons have enriched society as a whole and our profession specifically. Their contributions have helped to develop queer-positive practices, HIV/AIDS services, responses to women&rsquo;s health needs, activism for social justice, and improved social work knowledge and practice.</p>
                    <p>The homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism institutionalized within schools, the health-care system, and social services have led many gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgendered, and transsexual people to feel reluctant to ask for help. As a result, LGBTQ+ communities are developing queer-positive social services. These organizations are involved in policy change, community organizing, advocacy, and service provision. Most medium- and large-sized cities in Canada have social services specifically organized to meet the needs of LGBTQ+ persons.</p>
                    <p>The personal experience of heterosexism and oppression is felt through stigma, stress, guilt, and shame. It is often difficult to accept one&rsquo;s sexual and romantic attractions to people of the same sex because we live in a society that is generally hostile to such desires. It is equally difficult to accept one&rsquo;s sexual identity as different from what one is assigned at birth. Thus, many members of LGBTQ+ communities experience internalized homophobia. External cultural messages that suggest that lesbians, transgendered and transsexual people, and gay men are somehow failing to meet social standards become internalized as guilt, shame, and stress.</p>
                    <p>Often (although not necessarily) as a result of discrimination and devaluation by society, members of LGBTQ+ communities struggle with self-acceptance. On average, gay adolescents and young men are six to sixteen times more at risk for attempting suicide compared to their straight peers (Dorais, 2004). Studies have shown that it is not gay sexuality that causes suicide, but rather having a homosexual or bisexual orientation in a highly homophobic environment. Young gay men, lesbians, and transgendered youth are known to experience both ostracism and harassment in their everyday lives. They are sometimes rejected by their families and end up on the streets, where they are vulnerable to sexual and physical violence.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work with Persons Who Are Homophobic and/or Transphobic</p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="#" id="page-391" class="ch-link"></a>In their practice, social workers can encounter people hostile to LGBTQ+ persons. Generally, individual feelings of homophobia and transphobia are rooted in three different areas:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Religion.</span> In this situation, it can be helpful for the social worker to refer to religious teachings that promote acceptance and understanding. In addition, there is an increasing body of literature that argues that various religions do accept sexually and gender-diverse persons. See, for example, Daniel Helminiak&rsquo;s book What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality (1994, 2000) and Samar Habib&rsquo;s Islam and Homosexuality (2010).</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Insecurity in gender roles.</span> Sometimes homophobia and transphobia are rooted in insecurity about one&rsquo;s own gender identity. In this situation, exploring childhood messages about sexuality and gender and encouraging increased self-reflection can help to reframe the situation and make encounters with persons of diverse gender and sexual identities less threatening to the person concerned.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Negative past experience with someone who identifies as LGBTQ+.</span> In this situation, it can be helpful to increase someone&rsquo;s exposure to more positive experiences, first through films, books, or websites, and, when possible and safe for others, with people who are members of LGBTQ+ communities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The challenge for social workers is to develop compassion for people who show little compassion for others and to see that such attitudes are often a survival skill for those who feel powerless and insecure. It can be important to help such people refocus their anger in a more appropriate and positive way that encourages healthy attitudes and healthy living.</p>

                                <p>Gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered persons often seek social work support for issues similar to their non-queer counterparts. These problems may also be shaped by their experience of oppression. LGBTQ+ persons may also struggle with depression, suicidal ideation, alcoholism, and drug use, all of which can be prevalent among persons who live in a society that is hostile to their identities, desires, and relationships.</p>
                                <p>When working with a client to explore the problems that have brought them to counselling, it is important to see homophobia, heterosexism, transphobia, and cisgenderism as potential problems rather than perceiving the client’s sexual or gender diversity as being the problem.</p>
                                <p>For social workers who are not members of LGBTQ+ communities, the following are some guidelines for creating a space for diverse sexual and gender identities in their practice. Additionally, understanding the stages of coming out, the barriers faced by transsexual people, and the impacts of ethnicity, age, and ability are vital to effective practice in these communities.</p>
                                <ul class="ul--list">
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Never assume people are heterosexual or cisgender. </span>Use words such as “partner” and other gender-inclusive language. When asking a person about their life, articulate the possibility that the person may be attracted to people of the same sex. For instance, you can ask if a person is dating a man, woman, or transgendered person—in other words, leave open the possibility of non-heterosexual relationships. You can also ask people to tell you their preferred pronoun.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Affirm and validate. </span>If someone discloses that they are transgendered, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, it is important for social workers to affirm and validate that identity. Queer-positive counsellors view same-sex desire and transgendered identities as normal human diversity. Similarly, they recognize same-sex relationships as having the same value as heterosexual partnerships.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Feelings about gender and sexual diversity.</span> You cannot expect to grow up in a culture that is hostile to gender and sexual diversity and not internalize some of those feelings and stereotypes. If you cannot provide affirming counselling or if someone would prefer to work with a counsellor who is a member of an LGBTQ+ community, then you are obliged, whenever possible, to make the appropriate referrals. <span>Sometimes heterosexual counsellors avoid their own discomfort with same-sex desire by letting gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients talk only about their positive experiences of sexual diversity, but not about their struggles with feelings of shame or ambivalence.</span></li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Body language is important. </span>When working in areas of sexuality or gender that are uncomfortable, heterosexual counsellors may say supportive things, but their body language may convey discomfort. Body language can alienate clients with diverse sexual and gender identities.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Support your colleagues. </span>Support colleagues who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered. Do not rely on them to teach you about sexual or gender diversity.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Increase your own self-awareness. </span>This begins by exploring the heterosexist attitudes that we have all developed as a result of living in a heterosexist and cissexist culture. In particular, it can be helpful to unpack our binary assumptions about gender and sexual orientation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Many of us also need to move beyond positions of pity, tolerance, and acceptance to explore ways in which we can celebrate diversity and encourage others to do the same. It is important to see a client’s decision to accept a transgendered, bisexual, gay, or lesbian identity as a positive outcome of counselling.</p>
                                <p>If you are heterosexual and/or cisgendered, it is important to challenge the ways in which you take your heterosexual privilege for granted. If you identify as LGBTQ+, it is important not to over-identify with clients who are queer-identified. Particularly in small, tight-knit queer communities, it is important to be careful about boundaries and dual relationships.</p>
                                <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Supporting Clients in Coming Out</p>
                                <p>Revealing one’s LGBTQ+ identity to family and friends (a process known as “coming out”) can sometimes be a stressful and even frightening experience as the consequences can be perceived as unpredictable and perhaps risky. Katherine van Wormer and her colleagues (2000) identify a number of stages in the coming-out process; it is important that social workers understand and recognize these stages.</p>
                                <ul class="ul--list">
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item">The first stage occurs before a person comes out. People may feel discomfort, but do not consciously recognize being attracted to people of the same sex or not fitting within their assigned gender.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item">The second stage takes place when people begin to become aware of same-sex attraction or gender discomfort.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><a href="#" id="page-393" class="ch-link">In the third stage,</a> “exploration,” people develop gay, lesbian, or transgender friendships and participate in the LGBTQ+ community.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item">The final stage is marked by integration—people accept their identities and incorporate their identities into their lives.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Not everyone goes through all of these stages, however, or goes through them in this order. Also, people can be content without moving through all the stages.</p>
                                <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Transitions for Transsexual People</p>
                                <p>For transsexual men and women, achieving alignment between their gender identity and their physical body often requires hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgeries. In order to access these treatments, most people must receive a diagnosis of a gender identity disorder (GID) from one of three recognized gender identity clinics in Canada (Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver). The cost of transitioning varies significantly from province to province, depending on the provincial health plan. Even in a province where there is coverage, sex reassignment surgeries can include additional costs (such as travel) that make them prohibitively expensive.</p>
                                <p>For these reasons and others, some transsexual persons do not have complete sex reassignment surgery and instead use hormones to align their bodies to their gender identity to some degree.</p>
                                <p>Social workers can help by challenging how we designate washrooms or use language that excludes, marginalizes, and silences people who do not fit within the binaries of male and female or who seek transition from one to the other. For example, washrooms can be uncomfortable or even dangerous spaces for someone who does not fit within gender binaries. Transgendered people who cannot pass as the “appropriate” gender often face verbal harassment or even physical violence.</p>
                                <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Acknowledging Diverse Communities and Sexuality</p>
                                <p>People’s experiences of sexual or gender diversity are different depending upon their ethnicity, age, and abilities.</p>
                                <ul class="ul--list">
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Ethnicity.</span> Members of LGBTQ+ communities are ethnically diverse. As one of countless examples, Manitoba trans judge Kael McKenzie is of Aboriginal descent.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Age.</span> In North America, sex is largely seen as the terrain of the young. Older people who identify as gay, bisexual, or lesbian often face discrimination.</li>
                                    <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Disability.</span> People with disabilities are typically perceived as asexual (devoid of or without sexuality). Stereotypes make it difficult for people with disabilities to feel confident enough to seek out a partner. In addition, systems and institutions often work to prevent people with disabilities (especially intellectual disabilities) from having sexual relations.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>LGBTQ+ people also differ in terms of religion, education, socio-economic status, and other characteristics. Acknowledging this diversity prevents overly broad generalizations about LGBTQ+ people, and recognizes that they face multiple oppressions and have access to different levels of power.</p>

But many people report feeling relieved once they have come out and no longer have to hide their feelings and identities. People who live their lives &ldquo;out of the closet&rdquo; tend to have fewer experiences of isolation and depression.</p>
                        <p>Some people are out only to themselves and their partners. Others are out to family and friends, but remain closeted at work.

Most people in our society are not completely open to others&rsquo; sexual desires, practices, feelings, or even gender. There is no reason to expect LGBTQ+ people to be any different. To help a person who is grappling with decisions about whether, when, and how to come out, social workers must attune themselves to that person&rsquo;s particular needs, feelings, and experiences by listening carefully and responding with appropriate support, as Mike&rsquo;s story illustrates.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Issues Confronting LGBTQ+ Social Workers</p>
                        <p>For social workers who are LGBTQ+, there are a number of important issues to take into account when working with clients and colleagues:</p>
                        <ul class=ul--list>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Social workers who are LGBTQ+ can be excellent role models for people who are attempting to deal with their own same-sex desires or transgendered identity. Hiding one’s sexual orientation can send a message that gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons should feel ashamed. Hiding one’s gender identity or personal history can send a similarly negative message about transgendered, intersex, and transsexual people. However, LGBTQ+ social workers must also assess any potential risks that might accompany coming out in their workplaces, particularly as clients are not bound to confidentiality.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">It may be challenging for LGBTQ+ social workers to deal with clients who are hostile to LGBTQ+ communities. It may be appropriate to refer such clients to another counsellor, particularly if the social worker feels threatened on any level.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">As members of a marginalized community, LGBTQ+ social workers may worry that the risks of making mistakes are higher, as these mistakes might be attributed to their identity or community. This may add pressure to their workload if they are not practising in a queer-positive workplace. It is important to try to find allies and colleagues who can offer support.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Gay, lesbian, transgendered, and bisexual service providers can themselves be uncomfortable with other forms of sexual and gender diversity. All social workers should think through and be aware of their own beliefs and preconceptions when working with members of LGBTQ+ communities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Practising in a small community can present particular challenges, because social workers are more likely to meet clients outside of the counsellor–client relationship. It is important to be aware of the possibility of overlapping roles and to get support from colleagues to help maintain professional boundaries.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-395" class="ch-link">Social workers can help</a> support people through the coming-out process, but they must always be mindful of their clients&rsquo; apprehensions and possible ambivalence.</p>
                            <p>Kim, a social worker at a non-profit organization that supports youth, receives a call from a young man who is enrolled at the local university. Sounding distressed, the young man begins the conversation by asking for reassurance about confidentiality. He doesn&rsquo;t want to give his real name, so Kim agrees to call him &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; throughout the conversation. She assures him that the organization does not keep track of people&rsquo;s phone numbers and that she can work with him anonymously unless she becomes concerned that he might hurt himself or others. Mike agrees to this condition.</p>
                            <p>Mike tells Kim that he is scared and anxious because he has noticed himself becoming aroused in the university change room when showering with other men. He has never thought of himself as gay, and he had a few girlfriends in high school to whom he felt attracted. He is confused by his arousal and what it means. He tells KIm that he has fairly negative feelings about gay men, and he states that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be gay. However, he does admit that he has never felt the intensity of desire that he is now feeling when observing other men at the gym and in the showers. He is deeply conflicted, as he is experiencing feelings of fear and disgust, but also excitement and anticipation. He feels nervous that he will be &ldquo;caught&rdquo; if he acts on his desires, but at the same time he feels overwhelmed by his yearning for sexual intimacy with another man, and he tells Kim he can&rsquo;t stop thinking about it.</p>
                            <p>Kim spends some time talking with Mike to help him process his situation. Mike asks Kim whether she thinks he is gay, and she replies that whether he is gay or not depends on how he defines himself. She suggests that perhaps the definition isn&rsquo;t as important as taking some time to explore his new feelings and deciding whether he wants to act on them, and if so, how he can do so in a way that is safe. Kim points out that how an individual defines their sexual orientation is a personal choice and that Mike need not feel pressured into making that choice before he feels truly ready to do so.</p>
                            <p>Mike speaks about how sad he will be if he discovers that he is gay. He talks about disliking gay men and feeling a sense of loss because he won&rsquo;t be able to have a family and kids. He says that loss will be hard for him and his parents. Kim spends some time discussing Mike&rsquo;s perceptions and stereotypes about gay men. It is clear that he has not known any out gay men and that his images of gay sexuality derive mainly from popular culture. Kim suggests a few videos that Mike might watch to challenge his stereotypes. They discuss how a person&rsquo;s expression of gender is not just about sexual orientation and how some gay men are conservative and masculine in their gender expression, while others are more playful. Kim also points out that having a family and children is a possibility for gay men today. Kim also talks about safe places where Mike might go to meet other men.</p>
                            <p>Mike calls Kim several times over the next few weeks to talk more about his feelings of internalized homophobia and about how he could gain more social support. As Mike discusses his plans to try to meet some gay men for sexual encounters, Kim points out how important it is to practise safe sex by using condoms. They engage in explicit conversations about the risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.</p>
                            <p>After a month, Mike calls Kim again and sounds much calmer. He has been to a gay bar a few times and has had good experiences. His fears are being replaced slowly with the realization that being gay might mean that he could meet other gay men, fall in love, and enjoy a loving relationship with another man.</p>
                            <p>Mike has also disclosed his feelings to a friend who has been supportive as Mike realigns his identity. Mike has not disclosed his transforming identity to family members, but he does not think that doing so will present any major threats to his relationships with them. He is certain that his mother will be understanding, and he thinks that eventually his father will come to terms with the situation as well.</p>
                            <p>Mike now tells Kim his real name and thanks her for all the support that she has given him over the past few months. He says that he is still not exactly sure how things will turn out, but he states that he is feeling less afraid and even excited about some of the possibilities that lie ahead for him.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-396" class="ch-link"></a>Despite the wide range of sexual and gender diversity, many people assume that everyone is heterosexual and cissexual. For example, how many heterosexuals and cissexuals have to think twice before deciding which washroom to use or whether they should display a photograph of their partner in their office? Without thinking through the ways in which heterosexuals and cissexuals move through the world, without an awareness of or support for gender and sexual diversity, heterosexual and cissexual social workers may consciously and unconsciously maintain heterosexual and cissexual privilege.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Supporting Intersex People and Their Families</p>
                        <p>The broad category of intersex includes people with a variety of chromosomal variations, those whose bodies have difficulty using androgens (male sex hormones), and people whose genitals are ambiguous at birth. The challenge is that while intersex people may have bodies that cross boundaries of sex, living in this manner is not a widely recognized option in our society; there is a great deal of pressure for children to adhere to the binary gender system.</p>
                        <p>Parents of intersex children need information, and sometimes advocacy, so that they can negotiate with doctors regarding what medical interventions they want taken or whether they would rather wait until their child reaches puberty to make any decisions. The Intersex Society of North America argues that intersexuality is mainly a problem of stigma and trauma, not gender, and that children with external sex characteristics or genitalia that are indeterminate should not undergo surgery, but rather should be assigned a gender based on their genetic and hormonal test results.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Supporting Sexual and Gender Diversity</p>
                        <p>While people who are intersex, transgendered, or transsexual deal with the same life issues as people who are not negotiating their gender identity, some counselling issues are specific to members of these communities. For example, many such persons experience harassment, physical violence, and estrangement from family and friends.</p>
                        <p>For transsexual men and women, achieving alignment of their gender identity and physical body often requires hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgeries. Barriers to transitioning are significant and can include expensive procedures and long prescribed wait times during which an individual must live as the gendered person they intend to become before receiving drugs or surgery. The social and regulatory issues that surround sex reassignment are highly specialized areas of practice. In most large cities, there are social work practitioners who specialize in gender counselling. It is important, when possible, to provide support and to refer people to counsellors with expertise in this area.</p>
                        <p>It is also important for social workers to be aware that transsexual people are homosexual, bisexual, asexual, and heterosexual in about the same proportions as cissexual people. And many transsexual people choose not to be part of LGBTQ+ communities, but to live ordinary lives in their affirmed sex and gender.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold">
                                <a href="#" id="page-397" class="ch-link"></a>In a society struggling with long-held misconceptions that sex is a binary category that has only two possibilities, male or female, social workers can play a key role.</p>
                            <p>Zahide works for a counselling service located on a university campus. One day, Jade comes in for an appointment to discuss a troubling issue. Jade is in the process of transitioning from being a female to a gender-queer or non-binary person and thus prefers the pronoun &ldquo;they.&rdquo; Jade is uncomfortable in several classes where their legal name is read out instead of their preferred name and is often uncomfortable having to speak with faculty in advance of these classes to ensure that this does not continue to happen. Jade also feels upset when in the company of peers who seem uncomfortable speaking with or even sitting next to a gender-queer person.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes professors and teaching assistants seem supportive of Jade&rsquo;s request to be referred to in the plural, but at other times they seem confused or irritated. Others do not respect the request at all, ignoring it entirely and refusing to engage in a conversation about gender diversity.</p>
                            <p>Jade becomes quite anxious at the beginning of each term, not knowing whether or how their request will be heard. When their request goes unheeded, Jade drops a course, or, in the case of a required course, is compelled to endure a very uncomfortable experience. This discomfort is adversely affecting their concentration and ability to learn. Jade is in a state of constant hypervigilance, feeling unsure whether seemingly critical comments made by an instructor are related to their learning, or whether the comments reflect the educator&rsquo;s discomfort with a gender-queer identity.</p>
                            <p>None of the educators has been explicitly hateful toward Jade, but they have expressed annoyance or impatience at times. Such responses are not grounds for a complaint, but they can create an environment in which Jade never feels certain that they are fully accepted in a particular classroom. This uncertainty is proving to be emotionally draining for Jade.</p>
                            <p>Jade describes other stressful experiences on campus; for example, when negotiating washroom use, showing their student card in order to gain access to the recreation centre or library, or paying for a coffee at a campus site. The photo on Jade&rsquo;s campus ID card was taken 18 months previously, when Jade&rsquo;s appearance was more gender conforming. As a result, university staff are sometimes confused and skeptical when they see the differences between the photo and Jade&rsquo;s current appearance.</p>
                            <p>While there are some gender-neutral washrooms on campus, they are situated relatively far apart from each other and are not always located in buildings where Jade is taking classes. Thus, Jade is sometimes forced to use a washroom in which their gender might be questioned, creating an unsafe situation. These daily experiences of having to justify a non-conforming gender identity are beginning to take a toll on Jade&rsquo;s mental health.</p>
                            <p>Zahide spends much of the first few sessions listening to Jade&rsquo;s story and validating their feelings. Zahide ensures that she reflects back Jade&rsquo;s preferred use of the plural pronoun. Zahide then does some research and finds out that the university has a &ldquo;preferred name&rdquo; policy that is in development. This should help Jade deal with some of the institutional challenges they are facing, as students will have the option to identify a preferred name that will appear on class lists and class websites. Zahide finds out what institutional pathways Jade should follow to have their photo ID changed and to have their preferred name entered into the system.</p>
                            <p>Zahide and Jade also discuss some trans-positive spaces on campus that Jade could access in order to develop more supports in navigating the cisnormative university environment. In this way, Zahide helps Jade develop a network to support them through a difficult transition. Zahide also knows some activists on campus who have been working to increase the number of gender-neutral washrooms, and she asks Jade if they might be interested in joining that group.</p>
                            <p>Alongside these concrete interventions, Zahide validates that it is challenging to be a non-binary person at this university and offers to provide Jade with ongoing support and counselling as necessary to help them cope with their situation.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-398" class="ch-link"></a>The exchange of sex for money has taken on a peculiar shape in modern societies. It not only continues to be widespread, but also, with the freer movement of people around the world, it has become globalized, like many other things.</p>
                        <p>In 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada found that laws prohibiting brothels, public communication for the purpose of prostitution, and living on the profits of prostitution were unconstitutional and gave Parliament 12 months to rewrite the laws. In December 2014, the Harper government introduced new legislation that made it illegal to purchase sexual services, but legal to sell them. With this move, the government argued that it was recognizing prostitution as a form of sexual exploitation that negatively and disproportionately affects women and girls. The new legislation is contentious, with some applauding the changes and others worrying that it violates the Constitution and may be very difficult to implement.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Understanding the Challenges Faced by Sex-Trade Workers</p>
                        <p>Given the sub-legal nature of the sex-trade industry, it might be easy for some people to overlook the fact that individuals who work in the sex trade are human beings with their own private lives and private troubles. Many have families, children, and partners. For many of these workers, leaving the sex trade may seem impossible. Without sufficient education or job ex-perience, it may be the only way to make money to support their families and pay the rent.</p>
                        <p>Sex-trade workers are a diverse group. Many, but not all, are poor. Some women and men work as expensive escorts and earn substantial money for their services. At the other end of the spectrum, however, are people who walk the streets and receive money to help pay the rent, buy food, or finance their substance use disorder. Some people choose to enter the profession voluntarily. There are also teenagers (many of whom are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or trans-gendered) who work in the sex trade so they can leave dangerous home situations and earn enough money to live. Many of these teenagers have fled or been kicked out of their homes and must earn money somehow in order to survive. Prostitution is often called &ldquo;survival sex&rdquo; for this very reason&mdash;it is the only means by which some people can support themselves.</p>
                        <p>Every person&rsquo;s situation is complex and unique, requiring individualized attention. For social workers, a clear understanding of the highly risky nature of this industry, both for those involved in it and for those working with persons involved in it, is of prime importance. After that, concern for the safety of those exploited by the industry is paramount.</p>
                        <p>Social workers often help sex-trade workers who are in trouble with the law or who are dealing with the challenges of poverty. A key early step in working with a sex-trade worker is to assess whether that person wants to remain in the sex industry and enjoys the work, whether they are involved against their will, or whether they are in the trade because they face limited alternatives. Once a social worker understands a sex-trade worker&rsquo;s experience, they can work respectfully with that client, as Cindy&rsquo;s story demonstrates. It is important for social workers to reflect on how they feel about sex work, and to ensure that, in taking on a case involving a sex-trade worker, they respond to their client&rsquo;s experience of sex work rather than to their own beliefs and values related to such work.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-399" class="ch-link"></a>Sometimes it is not the work itself that presents challenges to sex-trade workers, but rather other issues in their lives, such as substance use, poverty, and the threat of violence.</p>
                            <p>Michel, a social worker at a community health centre, is working with Cindy to help her find affordable housing. Cindy is struggling with poverty. At the moment, she is homeless and has been staying at a shelter or sleeping at friends&rsquo; houses. Both arrangements are problematic: friends eventually get tired of her presence, but she fears for her safety at the shelter, where she also finds it difficult to follow the rules.</p>
                            <p>Cindy has been supporting herself in the sex trade for a long time, but over the last five or six years, she has struggled with a substance use disorder and a lessening of income as her overall health has declined. She has tried to get off drugs, but has found it impossible to stay clean. With her descent into extreme poverty, her work has become more dangerous. She often finds herself trying to negotiate with clients during drug deals and is often mistreated because people take advantage of the intensity of her substance use disorder. She sometimes ends up being abused and is unable on many occasions to demand that sexual partners wear condoms.</p>
                            <p>Cindy is in a vicious cycle: because she finds it so difficult to cope with poverty, she uses substances as a way to escape her anxieties, but this only makes things worse.</p>
                            <p>In trying to find housing for Cindy, Michel faces a number of obstacles. The first is to find accommodation that is safe and affordable. Second, there is some concern about whether Cindy will be able to maintain a home because she has been evicted a number of times as a result of noise and behaviour complaints, or failure to pay the rent.</p>
                            <p>Cindy is 37 years old and has very little education. She can read a little, but has trouble with comprehension. She has no other job training. For Cindy, working in the sex trade was one of the few options she saw available to her and, until recently, this work had allowed her to earn a decent living. She liked many of her clients and the other women with whom she worked, who helped to keep her safe. However, age, substance use, and health problems are now compromising Cindy&rsquo;s capacity to earn a living in the sex trade. Her work can no longer provide enough income and security for her to live with dignity. Cindy is proud that she has survived on her own for this long, but she is very worried about what the future holds for her.</p>
                            <p>Michel adopts a harm-reduction approach in his work with Cindy. This means that he is always looking for opportunities to reduce the risks that Cindy faces, whether that means trying to ensure that she practises safer drug use or safer sex, or attempting to help her gain some measure of stability in terms of her housing or health care. Michel focuses on small steps as being key to Cindy&rsquo;s survival. He tries to use these small steps as markers to help build Cindy&rsquo;s hope for a better future.</p>
                            <p>Michel and Cindy have worked together for many years, and Cindy now trusts Michel because he doesn&rsquo;t judge her on the basis of her substance use or the nature of her work. For Michel, this trust is crucial to his effectiveness as a social worker, but the work is daunting at times. He has been able to find Cindy housing and has set up supports for her on many occasions, but it has been hard for her to sustain these supports, and she often ends up back on the street, where she experiences significant risk of violence and abuse. Cindy has undergone treatment in the past but has always returned to using intravenous drugs. Cindy wants to continue doing sex work as it is the only form of job security she has known.</p>
                            <p>Michel knows that safe, supportive housing is vital for Cindy&rsquo;s survival, and he works with her to find a place that she can afford. They locate a rooming house, but it is a risky environment for Cindy because the other tenants are mostly men and, in all likelihood, many of them are struggling with substance use disorders as well. Michel puts Cindy&rsquo;s name on several wait lists for non-profit housing, but he knows that they are very long.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, most of Michel&rsquo;s work with Cindy centres on maintaining the connection between them so that Cindy knows she always has someone to turn to if she is in crisis or needs immediate assistance.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-400" class="ch-link"></a>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a sexually transmitted blood-borne retrovirus that undermines a person&rsquo;s immune system. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the stage of HIV infection in which the immune system is destroyed. HIV/AIDS is a worldwide pandemic. In 2013, UNAIDS (a United Nations AIDS program) estimated that 35 million people were living with the disease. Of these, 3.2 million were children. The majority of these people live in the developing world. While the situation is serious, efforts by the UN and many national governments have significantly reduced the severity of the crisis. In 2005, AIDS-related deaths began to reverse, falling by 41 percent globally by 2014. Between 2000 and 2014, new HIV infections dropped from 3.1 million to 2 million worldwide, a reduction of 35 percent.</p>
                        <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada estimated that by 2012, there were 76,275 people living with HIV in Canada. In that year, 2,062 new HIV cases were reported, with 23.1 percent of them involving females. The most common modes of transmission for women were intravenous drug use (56.5 percent) and heterosexual sex (39 percent). For men, the most common transmission modes were heterosexual sex (39 percent), homosexual sex (31.6 percent), and intravenous drug use (23.7 percent).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Challenges Faced by Individuals and Communities Impacted by HIV/AIDS</p>
                        <p>People who have been exposed to HIV/AIDS are anxious about whether they have contracted the disease. If they test positive for HIV, they then confront stigma, the difficulties of managing a chronic disease, and sexual health issues. People who live with HIV must grapple with health-care coverage, disclosure, and maintaining employment while coping with fluctuations in levels of wellness. With the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure, people who are already vulnerable must negotiate very difficult disclosures of their HIV status.</p>
                        <p>The services that social workers can provide for people with HIV/AIDS include prevention in-itiatives, primary care, hospital care, home care, hospice care, support groups, family support, and advocacy. Social workers can also provide information and public education, make referrals to community resources, and prepare discharge plans. Social workers, like the one in James&rsquo;s story, often play a pivotal role as part of a larger health-care team.</p>
                        <p>In the community at large, social workers advocate on behalf of those living with HIV/AIDS through community organization and policy initiatives in relation to HIV/AIDS prevention, public education, and health promotion.</p>
                        <p>Social workers in community agencies can also facilitate support groups and provide counselling when necessary. The challenges of living with HIV vary significantly depending on a person&rsquo;s past experiences and social location. People who are recent immigrants to Canada or who belong to communities where HIV carries significant stigma often struggle with isolation. People who live in remote communities may find it difficult to access supports and services. In addition, for people who are already dealing with mental health challenges, addictions, or poverty, an HIV diagnosis is particularly difficult to manage. Whatever the situation, social workers play a vital role in terms of advocacy and support for people living with HIV/AIDS.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-401" class="ch-link"></a>In many hospital cases, the social worker is the only team member who deals with a patient&rsquo;s non-medical or non-physical needs. They also work with family and friends to provide information and support after a patient leaves the hospital.</p>
                            <p>James comes into a health centre to receive an HIV/AIDS test. As the social worker on the team, Anthony provides pre-test counselling for James. The first topic that Anthony addresses is the limits of confidentiality, particularly in the context of HIV testing. In Ontario, the public health agency is notified of all positive HIV test results, and efforts are made to contact past partners without disclosing the patient&rsquo;s name so that these partners can take care of their own health. Another key point that Anthony discusses in the pre-test counselling session is the &ldquo;window period&rdquo; for infection. It can take up to three months from the moment of exposure to the virus for a person to test positive for HIV. If someone tests negative for HIV, it does not mean that they have not been exposed, and they might indeed test positive at a later date.</p>
                            <p>Anthony ensures that James understands the implications of an HIV test, the implications of a positive result, and ways to reduce one&rsquo;s risk of contracting HIV. Anthony spends some time discussing the pros and cons of an HIV test. Throughout the counselling session, he discusses how James might reduce his risk of exposure to HIV through safer sex and safer drug use practices. James doesn&rsquo;t use intravenous drugs. He practises safe sex with his long-time partner, and usually does so when they have a threesome or when he engages with another sex partner. However, in a recent sexual encounter that he and his partner had with another man, they had all agreed that since no one was HIV positive, they would engage in risky sexual play.</p>
                            <p>A while later, James returns to the health centre for his test results. Anthony discloses that James has tested positive for HIV. In this session, Anthony takes time to discuss James&rsquo;s reaction to the diagnosis and to assess ways in which James can keep himself and others healthy. The diagnosis stirs up a lot of turbulent emotions and concerns for James. He feels ashamed that he did not use a condom 100 percent of the time. He has worked in the area of AIDS prevention and is quite knowledgeable about how people can protect themselves from the virus.</p>
                            <p>Anthony supports James in developing self-compassion and in acknowledging that we are all human and do the best we can, yet sometimes we make risky decisions and sometimes we get hurt. James is worried about disclosing his HIV status to friends and family, who would have expected him to always practise safer sex to avoid infection. He is not sure whether to disclose his health status to his teenaged son. He is concerned about what the diagnosis will mean for his relationship with his current partner, including its effect on their sex life. James is also worried about his future health, the side effects of the HIV drugs he will be taking, and the challenges he could face in finding a drug cocktail that will help manage his disease.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the counselling session, Anthony makes sure that James has an opportunity to talk openly about his feelings and to have those feelings validated. He also works with James to try to decrease his shame and to strengthen his capacity to discuss his diagnosis with his partner. Together, Anthony and James weigh the pros and cons of James disclosing his diagnosis to others in his life. For James, this brings up a lot of old negative feelings associated with deciding whether and when to come out as a gay man. Those decisions were emotionally exhausting, and James feels frustrated that he may now have to live in &ldquo;another closet.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>At the end of the counselling session, James agrees to come back to see Anthony after he has had a few days to absorb the news of his diagnosis. Before James leaves, Anthony makes sure that James has someone he can talk to and that he feels supported. Anthony knows that James is at risk for depression as a result of his diagnosis. Anthony offers James the name of a counsellor working in the field of HIV who could provide on-going support should he need it.</p>
                            <p>Apart from these counselling sessions, most of James&rsquo;s health-related questions are directed to his doctor, who outlines current changes in managing HIV and engages in a hopeful yet accurate discussion with James about his prognosis.</p>

                                <a href="#" id="page-402" class="ch-link"></a>Dillon Black has worked with the Ottawa Coalition to End Violence Against Women for the past several years.</p>
                            <p>The work I am most passionate about is queering anti-violence and intimate partner violence. Few services and supports exist for queer and trans survivors of violence. LGBTQ+ intimate partner violence forces us as a sector to examine some of the differences between the experiences of LGBTQ+ survivors and those of other survivors, to see how patterns of power and control are established, and to analyze how heteronormativity, homophobia, and transmisogyny affect the lives of queer and trans folks.</p>
                            <p>I came to anti-violence work as a method of both healing and belonging. As a queer non-binary person who is also a survivor of violence, it&rsquo;s always been hard to see myself reflected in anything, so for me, a part of this work is striving to find and model who I am. My first exposure to this work was through grassroots social justice and feminist activism, finding and building community. I have worked with survivors and perpetrators, facilitated therapy groups, and done crisis counselling, prevention work, and case management. One thing that&rsquo;s clear to me is the importance of talking things through and situating gender-based violence within a larger context of tiny moments and choices between intent and affect. Queer and trans communities are full of strong and resilient people who have survived many barriers to simply being in the world, combined with so many other experiences of isolation and oppression.</p>
                            <p>For as long as I can remember, I have seen intimate partner violence and gender-based violence all around me. In the queer community, we don&rsquo;t talk about violence&mdash;a huge silence exists. The more I became involved in anti-violence and feminist work, the more people would approach me and disclose their experiences to me. I knew things had to change. I had to bring a queer and trans lens to this work and demand a rethinking of gender.</p>
                            <p>My work and praxis are grounded in queerness, social justice, anti-oppression, and resiliency frameworks. In the anti-violence movement, we often focus so much on eradicating violence that we don&rsquo;t always think about what is to be put in place of that violence. I am invested in creating a world in which our communities are equipped with the skills and knowledge to support everyone and in which there is no longer a need for crisis centres and hotlines. This work for me is about breaking through the shame induced by rape culture and bringing people together to build an alternative society.</p>
                            <p>I love that my gender and my body politicize any space I walk in and that I get to push those boundaries. It&rsquo;s crucial for me, and others like me, to be present in these spaces and to help this field rethink and deconstruct gender and its implications for anti-violence work. I love that I have this wonderful community of bad-ass feminists and advocates who stand in solidarity and embrace difference, while at the same time, I can challenge and push for change within those circles. I love the intergenerational community that I engage with and all of the teaching and knowledge translation that happens. I feel humbled that I am here to do support work but happy also that I can do prevention work; it helps me to understand transformative possibilities that help to build capacity for hope. While doing work with survivors of rape and sexual violence can be emotionally taxing, it&rsquo;s also incredibly healing for me to share and connect with folks who have survived, who have made choices, who have agency, and who keep pushing back. I think my favourite part of my role is engaging with young people who inspire me and help me to learn and unlearn, while I get to share my own stories and knowledge with them as well.</p>
                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Challenges of Doing Anti-Violence Work</p>
                            <p>Doing anti-violence or other community work is challenging because it&rsquo;s almost always reactionary and we often don&rsquo;t get to see change in our lifetime. Personally, one of the biggest challenges is my own gender and identity and where these fit in this work. As a gender non-conforming person who works to end violence against women, it can be incredibly invalidating to not ever see yourself represented or to feel that your experience is somehow being left out. For me, one of the biggest challenges is having my whole heart in this work and not letting it consume me. I don&rsquo;t think you have to cut off your emotions or your capacity for empathy, but I do know that it is incredibly important to keep ourselves grounded in this work and to make sure we are taking care of ourselves.</p>
