Today, however, public (government-run or government-funded) social programs and services are widespread and affect nearly every Canadian at some point in his or her life. Nevertheless, while social services are commonplace, Canadians generally are not very aware of the history of social work in this country or of the crucial role social workers play in our lives. This book is an effort to redress that imbalance. We hope that it will help you become familiar with the key concepts and issues in social work practice in Canada today.</p>

                        <p>The term <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">“welfare state”</span> is fequently used to describe a system of government whereby the state actively undertakes to protect the health and well-being of its citizens, especially those in financial need. The key elements of a welfare state are: (1) the use of the powers invested in government to provide essential social services to citizens, and (2) the use of grants, taxes, pensions, and other programs to provide basic income security. It is within this complex web of income security programs and social services that social workers practise their craft. The welfare state is, as it has loosely been described, a “social safety net.” It “catches” individuals and families in need and is designed to help them get back on their feet.</p>
                        <p>The kinds of difficulties that individuals and their families may face are three-fold: economic, personal, and family-related.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Economic survival.</span> Retirement, unemployment, decreasing income, and rising prices are examples of contingencies that affect economic survival.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The integrity of the person.</span> Disability, illness, violence, homelessness, substance use, racism, discrimination, warfare, and death are examples of contingencies that affect the integrity of the person.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Survival of the family. </span>Separation, divorce, the care of aging family members, and additional children are contingencies that threaten the very survival of the family.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In countries where the social safety net is weak or non-existent, there is little or no protection of this kind and individuals are left to fend for themselves. The Canadian social safety net gives citizens a greater sense of security and, many would argue, a greater sense of belonging.</p>

                        <p>The services provided by professional social workers are part of a range of activities that fall more generally under the term “social welfare.” Social welfare, in this wider sense, includes not only the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">social services</span> proper (such as child protection, women’s shelters, and counselling) but also a range of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-3">income security </span>provisions that provide monetary or other material benefits to supplement income or maintain minimum income levels (such as Employment Insurance, Social Assistance, Old Age Security, and Workers’ Compensation).</p>
                        <p>The distinction between the social services and income security is an important one, but one that is often hard to maintain in real life. The distinction is often a source of confusion for beginning social workers because frequently, difficulties come in pairs or in even more complex combinations. For example, a man who becomes ill or has an accident may also lose his job and, as a result, his home. A woman who is subjected to violence may be forced to leave her home and may need help obtaining child support as well as personal income support. A man with a substance use disorder may lose his job and be at risk of ending up homeless, incarcerated, or in the mental health system. Thus, social services are often needed to deal with problems that have their roots in economic insecurity and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>This book deals with the social services and the everyday practice of social work. It does not cover in any depth the complex income security programs in Canada that provide monetary assistance to individuals and families. However, because a basic understanding of the income security system is necessary for effective social work practice, it is a good idea to gain an overview of this vast field. A companion volume, <em>Social Welfare in Canada: Understanding Income Security,</em> more fully examines the income security field.</p>

                        <p>The basic goal of the Canadian social welfare system is not to replace individual initiative but rather to help people through difficult times until they can rebuild their lives. Few would dispute that when people desperately need help, the state, if not fellow citizens, should lend a helping hand. Yet the role of the state in providing welfare services is controversial. Some people reject the idea that the state should play any part at all, even in relation to helping our most vulnerable citizens. Others see a modest role for government&#173;—but only when all else fails. Still others want to see the state play a larger, more active role in redressing inequalities and creating social harmony by working to improve the lives of all citizens. Debates over the proper role of social welfare are far-reaching and can be heated; a cool head is a useful asset, especially to a new social worker.</p>
                        <p>Social services are provided to citizens through social policies developed by various levels of government and are delivered by means of specific social policies and programs.</p>

                    <p>The network of social welfare laws, policies, and programs currently in place around the country is vast. This complex system provides an underlying buffer against contingencies that can arise, often unexpectedly, and cause great hardship for individuals and their families. It is through such programs that the Canadian state creates opportunities for individuals experiencing difficulties in their lives and helps them get back on their feet.</p>
                    <p>On both the income security and the social services sides, there are different classes of welfare services. One important distinction is between public and private welfare programs.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Public Welfare Services</p>
                    <p>Because Canada is a federal state, <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">public welfare</span> is provided, in different forms, through the three levels of government: the federal or national government, the provincial and territorial governments, and the regional and municipal governments. Typically, agencies are created and charged with overseeing and delivering income security and social services to citizens on behalf of the government.</p>
                    <p>As well, there are “public” non-government agencies that provide services. These include advisory and appeal boards, which are the creations of government (federal, provincial, or municipal), consisting of members who are appointed from the public by government. They are either completely independent or quasi-independent of the government’s own agencies.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Private Welfare Services</p>
                    <p>There is also what can be referred to as <span class="span--keyword text--red">private welfare</span>, or programs funded by voluntary charitable contributions from individuals and private organizations, by fees people pay for the services they receive, or by funds spent by corporations to provide social welfare services to their employees.</p>
                    <p>Here, a distinction can be drawn between two types of private delivery organizations: private non-profit and private for-profit.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Non-profit </span><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">organizations</span> are mandated to provide a service or an activity, but not to create a profit. In Canada, these organizations are often registered, and rules and regulations govern their operation. Many are incorporated as non-profit corporations. Often, they receive funds from one or more levels of government. Indeed, governments seem to be moving more toward this delivery model. By moving services into non-unionized smaller agencies, labour costs and liability are lowered.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">For-profit </span><span class="text--bold text--bold-grey">organizations </span>are prevalent in certain income security areas (for example, pensions and insurance) and social service areas (for example, nursing homes, psychotherapy, home care, and child care). They essentially provide services for a fee and generate a profit for the owner offering the service. With government cutbacks in recent years, more and more services are being provided by for-profit or commercial agencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Non-profit and for-profit service providers, along with public government and non-government agencies, form the backbone of the social welfare system in Canada today. Sometimes it is an uneasy alliance. Advocates of private, for-profit welfare maintain that a for-profit system allows more choice (for example, private pension and insurance plans). Opponents point out, however, that the private system favours those most able to afford it, fosters social inequality, and undermines the public system.</p>

Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities are central to social work. Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and Indigenous knowledge, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing.”</p>

                    <p>In general, the idea that governments should provide income security and social supports to citizens if they are genuinely in need is not highly disputed in Canada (although it certainly is in the United States). Nevertheless, major disputes arise in determining exactly which groups are genuinely in need and to what extent they may need state assistance. Canadian governments have moved back and forth between two broad approaches to social welfare. These are sometimes referred to as the “residual view” and the “institutional view.”</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-6">The residual view. </span>In this view, social welfare is a limited response to human need, implemented only when all else fails. It is based on the premise that there are two “natural” ways through which an individual’s needs are met: the family and the market economy. The state should only step in when these normal supports fail. Social welfare should be targeted to those most in need, and typically, benefits are at a low level (so as to discourage abuse).</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red">The institutional view. </span>In this view, social welfare exists to ensure that everyone has a reasonable standard of living and health. In a complex industrial society such as ours, the argument goes, access to income supports and social services promotes a sense of civic solidarity and helps to even out inequalities that may be no fault of the individual concerned.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Until the Great Depression of the 1930s and its aftermath, social welfare programs in Canada were essentially residualist in nature. Welfare was only for those demonstrably in need. In the period after World War II, the idea that welfare services were necessary to any civilized society became more widespread. Since the turn of the century, if not earlier, policymakers have reverted to a more restricted notion, making cutbacks in welfare spending across the board.</p>

                    <p>When designing social welfare programs, a key distinction is whether they are universal or&#160;selective.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">Universal programs.</span>These programs are available to everyone in a specific category (such as people aged 65 and over, people with disabilities, or children) on the same terms and as a right of citizenship. The idea is that all persons are equally eligible to receive program benefits, regardless of income or financial situation.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red">Selective programs.</span>These programs target those who are found to be in need or eligible, based on a means (or income) test or a needs test. A means test determines eligibility based on the income of the prospective recipient. The benefit is reduced according to income level, and there is always a level at which no benefit is granted. A needs test determines eligibility based on the income and the need of the prospective recipient. Eligibility criteria are used to define need, which is then compared to the prospective recipient’s life situation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the post–World War II era, universal programs were seen as a way to build national solidarity. More recently, they have been viewed as too expensive and have all but disappeared. The foremost objection to universal programs is their cost. Giving a benefit to everyone, regardless of income, means that even the wealthy get a benefit. Universal programs are less expensive to administer, however, as they do not require the scrutiny of every person’s situation to determine eligibility.</p>

                    <p>Selective programs are often viewed as more efficient and less costly, as benefits are only provided to those most in need. However, identifying eligible recipients using means or needs tests can be administratively complex and costly and take money out of the system that could be directed toward benefits. In some cases, the higher administrative costs are being partially avoided by using the tax system as a method of determining eligibility and dispensing benefits. Increasingly, social policy experts are seeing that some selective programs are necessary for tackling poverty and inequality.</p>
                    <p>While some programs include aspects of universality, there are no income security programs remaining that can be exactly defined as universal. Health care and education are examples of universal service programs, but they are not income security programs. In the past, a number of universal income security programs were available to Canadians. Family Allowance, which was available from 1944 to 1993, is the most commonly cited example. All families with a child under the age of 18 were entitled to a financial benefit. Because of the progressive tax system, wealthier people paid much of the costs back through taxation, but it was nevertheless an acknowledgement of citizenship entitlement and of the importance and cost of raising children. In 1993, the Family Allowance was redesigned to become a targeted program, the Canada Child Tax Benefit (CCTB), only available to low- and middle-income families.</p>
                    <p>The Universal Child Care Benefit (UCCB) was introduced by the Conservative government in 2006 as a taxable benefit. In 2015, the Conservative government enhanced the UCCB to include a new benefit for children aged 6 through 17 and payments for children under the age of 6 were increased. Following up on an election campaign promise, early in 2016 the new Liberal government announced the Canada Child Benefit program, which pays up to $6,400 per child under age 6 and up to $5,400 per child aged 6 through 17. However, under the new program, the child benefits begin to phase out starting at $30,000 in net family income.</p>
            
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-13" class="ch-link">Selective Entitlements</a></p>
                    <p>All of Canada’s other income security programs offer selective entitlements. Most have complex selection criteria based on income, work history, or the willingness to find a job. Employment Insurance (EI), for example, is based on an insurance principle with eligibility tied to employment and income levels. Everyone within the broad category of “employee” pays into the program, so in this sense it is comprehensive, but a strict set of criteria determines who is eligible to receive benefits. The level of benefits depends on one’s earnings and contributions. With more demands being placed on the system, the debate over the amount and duration of EI payments is likely to heat up.</p>
                    <p>Other programs are based on how much money one has and whether it meets one’s needs. To be eligible for social assistance, one must prove that one’s income and assets fall below a certain level. In provinces with workfare, such as Ontario and Alberta, applicants must also comply with an employment or training placement.</p>
                    <p>Subsidized housing is another example of selective programming. Through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the federal government helps to improve access to affordable housing programs across the country. Most are administered by the provinces and territories.</p>

                    <p>Those who choose social work as their profession are typically motivated by humanitarian and egalitarian values, and by a desire to understand how society works and to make it better for everyone. Whatever the combination of factors that leads a person into the profession, social work demands more than just the desire to “do good.” The practitioner needs to have the analytical and hands-on skills, as well as the maturity and personal stability, that will allow her or him to bring about effective change.</p>
                    <p>In 2005, the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) formulated a new Code of Ethics, replacing the 1994 code, and added a separate document entitledGuidelines for Ethical Practice. The Code’s preamble defines social work practice as follows:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The social work profession is dedicated to the welfare and self-realization of all people; the development and disciplined use of scientific and professional knowledge; the development of resources and skills to meet individual, group, national, and international changing needs and aspirations; and the achievement of social justice for all. The profession has a particular interest in the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and/or living in poverty. Social workers are committed to human rights as enshrined in Canadian law, as well as in international conventions on human rights created or supported by the United Nations.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Over the past few years, the number of social workers has risen sharply. This rise is primarily attributable to the much greater range and intensity of social service needs, such as unstable family structures, family violence, child poverty, the aging of the population and the switch to home care, stress, substance use, dropping out of school, behavioural problems, and traumatic events. The fact that a growing proportion of these needs are handled by members of other occupations has only slightly slowed employment growth in this occupation. We will most likely see this trend continue over the next few years.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Direct and Indirect Social Work</p>
                    <p>It is common to distinguish between two types of social work.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-8">Direct social work</span> involves working face-to-face with people as individuals to provide services such as counselling, group work, and community development. This is typically done through a public (or publicly-funded) social service agency or institution, such as a hospital or child welfare agency.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red">Indirect social work</span> involves working with organizations that formulate, analyze, develop, and evaluate social policies and programs. It typically means working with social service agencies, research groups, and other groups whose purpose is to advocate for those in need.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The different kinds of practice can also be described as being either micro, mezzo, or macro social work.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Micro social work refers to direct practice with individuals and families.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Mezzo social work is social work with groups and communities.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Macro social work involves working with organizations or communities to improve or change laws or policies in general society.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Whether involved directly with citizens or indirectly through research, social workers are above all committed to serving people who are vulnerable or in need. They are there when circumstances are challenging or go wrong, or when people need help.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-15" class="ch-link">Casework and Beyond</a></p>
                    <p>The traditional notion of the social worker is that of a <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-9">caseworker</span>—a practitioner doing one-on-one counselling with individuals or families, usually working as part of a social service agency. Casework is what social workers are so highly respected for in the public eye. It is what social workers do ”on the ground,” every day; they become intimately involved, one-on-one, with many diverse populations, including the homeless, older adults, women, children and youth, LGBTQ+ persons, and persons with disabilities. They work in many different employment settings—in child welfare and family service agencies, schools, mental health clinics and hospitals, child guidance centres, industrial and labour organizations, and criminal justice settings. They bring a broad range of background knowledge and experience to help individuals and families in need.</p>
                    <p>Casework, then, involves doing rigorous and indispensible practical work with individuals and families, often in extremely difficult circumstances. Underlying this work is a body of theoretical knowledge and “best practices” that social work practitioners can call upon to help determine the best course of action. Because they have a deeper grasp of complex social issues and social problems, more often than not social workers also find themselves involved in advocacy, policy research, and even social movements.</p>

                                        <p>“Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment and domestic violence. Human rights and social justice are the philosophical underpinnings of social work practice. The uniqueness of social work practice is in the blend of some particular values, knowledge and skills, including the use of relationship as the basis of all interventions and respect for the client’s choice and involvement.”</p>
                                        <p>This definition of social work, provided by the Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW), emphasizes four key&#160;concepts:</p>

                                        <p>A social change/social justice mandate means working in solidarity with those who are disadvantaged or excluded from society so as to eliminate the barriers, inequities, and injustices that exist.</p>
                                        <p>This means that social workers should be at the forefront of policies and legislation that redistribute wealth in favour of those who are less well-off—that is, promoting equal opportunity for women, gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered persons, people with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, and racialized Canadians, and defending past gains in these areas.</p>
                                        <p>Commitment to social change and social justice is fundamental to social work practice. Reducing inequality of opportunity and seeking ways to redress social imbalances will reduce the need for welfare services.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Problem Solving</p>
                                        <p>Social workers respond to crises and emergencies as well as everyday personal and social problems. They use a problem-solving process and formulate possible plans of action. A&#160;problem is not usually clearly defined when someone comes to a social service agency. It is therefore crucial for the social worker to explore the person’s concerns, to identify the need(s) involved, to identify barriers to meeting need(s), and to carefully determine the goals and possible plans of action.</p>
                                        <p>A key characteristic of the problem-solving process is the inclusion of the client at each stage. The process should also teach clients problem-solving skills so that they can better deal with future problems on their own.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Person in Environment</p>
                                        <p>A key aspect of effective social work practice is to go beyond the “internal” (psychological) factors and examine the relationship between individuals and their environments. This person-in-environment approach largely distinguishes social work practice from other helping professions. These “environments” extend beyond the immediate family to include interactions with friends, neighbourhoods, schools, religious groups, laws and legislation, other agencies or organizations, places of employment, and the economic system. Based on this understanding, intervention may focus on the individual, interactions between people and any system or structure, or on the system or structure itself.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Empowerment</p>
                                        <p>In order for the interventions of social workers to be successful, clients must believe that the efforts of the practitioner, as well as their own efforts, will make a difference. This leads to the concept of empowerment. Being empowered means feeling that you have power and control over the course of your life.</p>
                                        <p>Empowerment is the process of increasing personal, interpersonal, or political power so that one can improve one’s particular situation. Power can be a personal state of mind, in the sense that one feels one can make a difference and have control and influence over one’s own life. It can also be empowerment within an organization in the sense that one has tangible influence and legal rights.</p>
                                        <p>Empowerment involves both a personal perception of being in control and tangible elements of power within the various social structures of society. Social workers seek to empower their clients as a way of helping them focus on access to resources and the structures of power, among other things.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-17" class="ch-link">Empowerment-based social work, therefore, has three main&#160;aspects:</a></p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet">making power explicit in the client-worker relationship (to help equalize the relationship between client and worker)</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">giving clients experiences in which they themselves are in control (to allow them to see the potential for controlling their lives)</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet">supporting the client’s efforts to understand the power relationships in their own lives, as well as their efforts to gain greater control over their lives as a way of promoting&#160;change</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Putting an empowerment perspective into practice involves techniques that make power relations between the workers and their clients explicit, thereby equalizing the client–worker relationship. It may entail giving clients&#173;—whether they be individuals, families, groups, or entire communities—experiences that put them in a position to exercise power. Voluntary work experiences that allow clients to use their skills to help others can be empowering. Another aspect may be to support clients’ efforts to change policies or practices that impinge on their lives and the lives of others.</p>
                                        <p>In other instances, an empowering perspective may involve simply focusing on the strengths of the person. In all relationships, it is generally acknowledged that constructive feedback and positive reinforcement are conducive to helping people make positive changes in their lives. Clearly, it is more helpful for social workers to guide their clients’ focus toward the success they have achieved in the past rather than dwelling on points where they have been less successful.</p>
                                        <p>An empowerment perspective is the key to good social work practice. And like other aspects of good practice, it involves not a specific set of skills, but a general orientation on the part of the worker. This orientation is based on helping clients identify their own needs and then assisting them to deal with the exigencies of their own particular situation.</p>
                                        <p>Of all the fundamental techniques available to the social work practitioner, the ability to empower the client is perhaps the most useful. The key is to help clients gain some sense of control over the difficult situation at hand and a sense that their actions will lead to positive results. Having the ability to foster a sense of client empowerment in sometimes difficult situations is an important part of the social worker’s skill set.</p>

                    <p>The social work profession is a personally taxing one. It requires a unique range of aptitudes and skills. Social workers and social service workers are called upon to uphold the highest standards of care and professionalism in relation to their clients and the highest professional and ethical standards in their relations with their colleagues.</p>
                    <p>A social work practitioner may need to assume a number of different roles, depending on the nature of their job and the approach to practice that they use. Obviously, the role that is selected and applied is the one that will be the most effective with a particular client in the particular circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Below are just some of the many roles that the social worker or social service worker needs to assume in the course of their work in helping clients get back on their feet:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Strategist. </span>The role of strategist involves the worker in helping people organize to help themselves; for example, helping a community identify problems, explore and select strategies, and organize and mobilize to address the problems.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Broker. </span>A broker links individuals and groups who need help; for example, linking a woman who is abused by her partner to a shelter for battered women.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Advocate. </span>In the role of advocate, the worker provides leadership in advocating on behalf of a person or in challenging an institution’s decision not to provide services.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Initiator. </span>The initiator calls attention to problems or the problems a particular policy or program may cause and follows up with colleagues or with an interdisciplinary team.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Mediator. </span>The role of mediator involves participating as a neutral player in disputes between parties to help them reconcile differences or achieve mutually beneficial agreements.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Negotiator. </span>As a negotiator, the social worker is allied with one side in a dispute and tries to achieve agreement by bargaining on his or her client’s behalf.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Activist. </span>The activist seeks to change institutions and structures in society, helping to organize people to shift power and resources to oppressed or disadvantaged groups.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Educator. </span>As an educator, the social worker provides information and resources and raises awareness of problems and solutions.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Coordinator. </span>The social worker is frequently a coordinator, bringing all the pieces together in an organized manner to accomplish a task.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Researcher. </span>As a researcher, the social worker gathers information for inclusion in databases and stays abreast of new findings in her or his field.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Facilitator. </span>The group facilitator may lead a group activity as part of group therapy, a self-help group, or any other type of group.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Spokesperson.</span> The social worker may be engaged as a public speaker at schools, at conferences or workshops, at events staged by service organizations, at meetings with police, or at gatherings within related agencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In whatever context social workers find themselves, they conduct themselves in a professional manner, using the knowledge and skills they have at their disposal and taking into account the specific needs of the client and the range of interventions currently available.</p>

                    <p>“Diagnostic services” are the purview of social workers (or in some provinces clinical social workers), whereas “diagnosis” has been excluded from the scope of practice for social service work. This means the<span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-10"> social worker </span>can make a series of judgements as to the nature of a situation and formulate the actions to be taken, or not taken, actions for which the social worker can be held accountable. The <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-11">social service worker</span>, on the other hand, may follow a suggested course of action based on a diagnosis, but he or she will not be the person who has arrived at such a judgement. The rationale for this is that the certification process is different for the social worker and the social service worker. The shorter time frame for the completion of a social service work program generally limits the depth and breadth of the interpersonal and social theory taught to social service workers.</p>
                    <p>For example, the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers specifies the scope of practice of the profession of social work as “the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of individual, interpersonal, and societal problems through the use of social work knowledge, skills, interventions, and strategies, to assist individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial and social functioning.” When the College specifies the scope of practice for social service work, the words “diagnosis” and “psychosocial” are omitted.</p>

                    <p>Whatever type of work is pursued, some post-secondary education is required in order to practise in the field of social work. In general, a university-trained person is referred to as a “social worker,” whereas a community college-trained individual is called a “social service worker.” In some provinces and in everyday contexts, this distinction is often ignored, although obviously university-trained individuals will have more years of training behind them.</p>
                    <p>The first trained Canadian social workers graduated from the University of Toronto’s Department of Social Services in 1914. Until the early 1970s, social work schools in Canada were accredited by the American Council of Social Work Education. There are now thirty-five universities offering social work degrees and forty-six community colleges offering diplomas, which are accredited by the Canadian Association of Social Work Educators (CASWE). A Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.) degree normally requires four years of university study. At least one additional year of graduate study is required for the Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) degree. A Diploma in Social Service Work from a community college requires at least two years of training. Those holding a non-social work undergraduate degree normally must complete two years of study for a Master of Social Work degree. There are currently twenty-nine M.S.W. programs offered in Canada.</p>
                    <p>Post-graduate study leading to a doctoral degree in social work is normally pursued by those who wish to teach at a university or those involved in high-level research, social policy, or large-scale administration. Eleven Canadian universities offer Ph.D.s in social work: Memorial University of Newfoundland, McGill University, University of Ottawa, University of Toronto, York University, McMaster University, Wilfrid Laurier University, University of Windsor, University of Manitoba, University of Calgary, and University of British Columbia.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Employment Opportunities in Social Work</p>
                    <p>The career opportunities for qualified social workers today are quite diverse, ranging from various public institutions to private practice and occurring within many different fields of&#160;experience.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Health and social services.</span> Job settings in this area include family and child welfare agencies, hospitals and other health care facilities, group homes and hostels, substance use treatment facilities, and Social Assistance offices.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Government services.</span> A large number of social workers work directly for some level of government, although this setting is declining as more and more services are devolved to community agencies.

                                        <p>Today, many Canadian social workers are members of public sector unions. Indeed, the social work profession was part of the wider unionization of the public sector during the 1960s and 1970s, when, for the first time, public sector employees were permitted to join a union.</p>
                                        <p>There was some debate over whether social workers should unionize, since social workers had their own professional associations and trade unions were traditionally associated with industrial workers. This matter was resolved by a division of labour. The associations represent social workers on issues pertaining to the development of the profession, education of members, and in social issues and social policy. The unions represent them in the areas of pay and working conditions. The associations and the unions in effect complement each other and both have mandates to act for those they represent.</p>
                                        <p>According to 2008 Service Canada data, 69 percent of social workers belong to unions, compared with 32 percent for all occupations. Forty-five percent of community and social service workers are unionized. The largest unions representing social workers are the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC). CUPE members are represented by provincial level divisions and sectors. For example, CUPE Ontario is broken down into five sectors: municipal, health care, school boards, university and social services. Social workers in children&rsquo;s aid societies, community living, children&rsquo;s care centres, municipal social services, community agencies (such as women&rsquo;s shelters), and municipal and charitable homes for the aged are all unionized.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers have benefited from unions in ways similar to other workers. Unions have helped to raise salaries, improve working conditions, and enhance job security. Pressure from female social workers and from the broader women&rsquo;s movement has encouraged the unions to address important issues such as equal pay, child care, maternity leave, pensions, and sexual harassment.</p>
                                        <p>Unions in social work agencies have also played another important role that is less well recognized. Labour unions have, throughout history, advocated for improved social programs, income security, and social services. Programs such as Employment Insurance and medicare would not exist today without pressure from the labour sector. As these programs come under increasing pressure from funding cuts, the unions are again playing a key role in opposing cutbacks.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Salaries of Social Workers</p>
                                        <p>Historically, social workers were among the lowest-paid service workers. Over the past ten years, the profession has enhanced its prominence through the establishment of provincial regulatory bodies called colleges. They regulate practice and control the qualifications necessary to enter the profession. This has brought credibility and growth to the profession.</p>
                                        <p>Over the past decade, the number of social workers has risen sharply. This can be attributed to expansion in the range of services undertaken by social workers and the intensity of needs. According to 2015 Service Canada data, the average annual employment growth rate was 2.5 percent for social work, compared to 0.8 percent for all other occupations. This trend is expected to continue.</p>
                                        <p>According to 2015 Service Canada data, 84.5 percent of social workers are women (compared to 48.1 percent for all others), and 84.4 percent work full time (compared to 81.2 percent for all others). The proportion of women in the profession has grown. According to census data, women held approximately 80 percent of social work jobs in 2006, a slightly higher proportion than in 1991 (73 percent). This proportion should continue to grow slightly over the next few years, since women make up between 80 and 90 percent of bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degree graduates. Social workers no longer languish near the bottom of the income scale, with the annual average income topping $52,000, compared with $50,300 for all other occupations.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Qu&eacute;bec Distinction</p>
                                        <p>A distinction must be drawn between social workers as defined by the National Occupational Classification (NOC) and those who are members of the Ordre des travailleurs sociaux et des th&eacute;rapeutes conjugaux et familiaux du Qu&eacute;bec. The NOC numbers include many social workers who are not members of the Qu&eacute;bec Ordre.</p>
                                        <p>This situation should change in the coming years, however, owing to the passage in 2009 of Bill 21 on the modernization of professional practices in mental health and human relations. This legislation limits previously unregulated practices to designated professionals only. Thus, a large number of human relations officers and community organizers who did not belong to the Ordre can be expected to join it in the near future. As well, the number of members of the Ordre increased by over 30 percent in 2012&ndash;2013, due largely to Bill 21.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">A decolonial pedagogy will ensure that we not only talk the talk of social justice, but that we lace up our metaphorical moccasins and walk the talk as well</p>
                                        <p>In 2004, I wrote an article titled &ldquo;Aboriginal Social Work Education in Canada: Decolonizing pedagogy for the seventh generation,&rdquo; and in this updated revision I include two key changes. First, I changed the term &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; to &ldquo;Indigenous.&rdquo; This is a significant shift as it reflects the evolution of Indigenous social work in the last decade. The original term &ldquo;Aboriginal&rdquo; is the constitutionally recognized term for Indigenous peoples in Canada. Using the term &ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo; in some ways represents a reclaiming of Indigenous identity because it is a self-identified and applied term. Its dictionary meaning is &ldquo;native to,&rdquo; which is appropriate in relation to First Peoples in North America and elsewhere. The term is also non-specific. It can serve to remind us that there are over 600 Indigenous communities speaking over 60 Indigenous languages in Canada. Thus, when we reflect upon Indigenous peoples and issues, we must ask, &ldquo;To which nation are we referring?&rdquo;</p>
                                        <p>Second, I changed &ldquo;Decolonizing&rdquo; to &ldquo;Decolonial&rdquo; pedagogy. &ldquo;Decolonial&rdquo; refers to the critical analysis and practical options that arise from critiquing and separating from the &ldquo;colonial matrix of power.&rdquo; Walter Mignolo (2011) explains this matrix as the colonial &ldquo;racial and patriarchal foundation of knowledge&rdquo; upon which Western social, political, and economic structures are based. Decolonial thinking and doing in social work require us to critique colonialism in Canada. This means analyzing the social, political, and economic incentives behind, for example, the slaughter of the buffalo, the killing of Inuit sled dogs, and the residential school system. Decolonial &ldquo;doing&rdquo; requires us to take action. Indigenous social work is a decolonial approach because it is based on critical analysis of colonial history and its consequences. Its intention is to foster effective practice to alleviate the harms caused by colonialism and to confront its contemporary manifestions (known as &ldquo;neocolonialism&rdquo;). These include ongoing systemic inequities, oppression, discrimination, and racism.</p>
                                        <p>But decolonial pedagogy goes further. It asserts traditional knowledge and tribal wisdom&mdash;which existed long before Western social work&mdash;as the theoretical, philosophical, and practice bases for social work education. Examples of decolonial pedagogy include Kathy Absolon&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Navigating the Landscape of Practice: Dbaagmowin of a Helper&rdquo; (2009); Cindy Baskin&rsquo;s book Strong Helpers&rsquo; Teachings: The Value of Indigenous Knowledges in the Helping Professions (2012); Jacquie Green&rsquo;s narrative about the significance of Oolichan fishing for the Haisla in her chapter &ldquo;Gyawaglaab (Helping One Another): Approaches to best practice through teachings of Ooolichan fishing&rdquo; (2009); and Renee Linklater&rsquo;s book Decolonizing Trauma Work: Indigenous Stories and Strategies. These works, among many others, demonstrate how Indigenous knowledge and wisdom can inform and shape social work theory and practice. Indigenous social work has come a long way in a short period of time!</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Origins of Indigenous Social Work Education</p>
                                        <p>Indigenous social work emerged from the Indigenous social movement of the 1970s that was sparked by the social revolution of the 1960s. In Canada, this movement saw the implementation of the Bill of Rights and the Indigenous franchise. Indigenous social work evolved in response to our Elders&rsquo; call for social work that was sociologically relevant to Indigenous peoples. Recognizing that Western-trained social workers might be unable to meet the needs of the Indigenous population, several Indigenous social work programs were initiated in the early 1970s. One of the first was the First Nations University of Canada (formerly the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College) School of Indian Social Work, established in 1974. Currently, there are several Indigenous undergraduate social work programs, as well as three Indigenous M.S.W. programs. In addition, many Canadian universities offer Indigenous specializations.</p>
                                        <p>In 2015, the student caucus of the Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE) moved that all schools of social work in Canada include mandatory Indigenous social work classes at the B.S.W. and M.S.W. levels. The motion was passed unanimously by representatives of all accredited social work schools in Canada.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-23" class="ch-link">Since 1974</a>, Indigenous social work has evolved: it draws upon generalist theory and practice while paying particular attention to colonial history and its traumatic outcomes. Social work education&rsquo;s theoretical foundation is tribal knowledge and wisdom. Indigenous social work aims to train both Indigenous and non-Indigenous social workers so that they understand colonial history, its intergenerational and contemporary effects on Indigenous peoples, and how to best practise social work with Indigenous peoples.</p>
                                        <p>Contemporary generalist cross-cultural approaches and anti-oppressive social work education are valuable in and of themselves. However, Indigenous peoples require social work praxis (theory and practice) that go deeper. Generalist social work does not focus sufficiently on Indigenous issues. Also, the social work profession and social work education have not been free from colonial influence. In the words of Brazilian activist and educator Paulo Freire (2001), &ldquo;the social worker, as much as the educator, is not a neutral agent, either in practice or in action.&rdquo; Indeed, many early social work practices were complicit with government colonial actions and those who protested were silenced (Moran, 1992).</p>
                                        <p>When Indigenous peoples began to protest the residential schools system and the schools began to close due to disrepair in the late 1950s, the child welfare system suddenly emerged. It led, almost overnight, to the over-representation of Indigenous children in the child welfare system that we see today. Social work was responsible for child welfare apprehensions of Indigenous children who were transracially adopted or institutionalized in long-term foster care. We refer to this period as the &ldquo;Sixties Scoop&rdquo; (Johnston, 1983), and Dr. Lauri Gilchrist has termed the post-1990 ongoing over-representation the &ldquo;Millennium Scoop.&rdquo; </p>
                                        <p>The numbers of Indigenous children being adopted out via the foster care system are still high. Because of policy and legal mechanisms, we are in a period that I refer to as the &ldquo;Foster Care Scoop.&rdquo; Indigenous peoples have long decried child removal as genocidal&mdash;the deliberate destruction of Indigenous culture.</p>
                                        <p>The social work profession is beginning to account for its role in colonialism and to contribute to a decolonial pedagogy. This involves going beyond theoretical understandings of inequity and recognizing that Indigenous systems of knowledge and action can guide mainstream social work education and practice. However, we must first be willing to accept that other epistemologies, or world views, exist. Karen Martin (2003) describes epistemology as &ldquo;ways of knowing, doing, and being&rdquo; in the world. These ways of knowing, being, and doing reflect a nation&rsquo;s philosophies and ethics. These in turn shape how families, communities, and institutions operate. By extension, world views also inform how we operate in the helping fields.</p>

                                        <p>Indigenous epistemology includes two key principles: the ethic of relationality and the ethic of reciprocity. You may have heard of the Indigenous concept of &ldquo;All My Relations.&rdquo; This term refers to the ethic of relationality. Thomas King (1990) describes this ethic as the recognition of our commonality as humans, and our connectedness to all life forms, including the Earth. (See the quotation below.) This ethic imposes upon us the responsibility to treat each other and the world in the way we would treat our closest relative.</p>
                                        <p>The second principle is the ethic of reciprocity. This ethic refers to the concept of balance through giving and receiving. We see this ethic play out in ceremonies, acts of gift giving, and tobacco offering. The act of offering tobacco or gifts is done in any context in which a request is made or in which there is an anticipation of receiving. The aim is to maintain balance in the physical world and, more importantly, in the metaphysical and spiritual realms. The purpose of striving for balance is to maintain spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical wellness and harmony.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Our Collective Social Work Journey Forward</p>
                                        <p>Indigenous social work offers a decolonial pedagogy that contributes to the theoretical and practice knowledge of social work. It is meant for everyone. However, our social locations as Indigenous or non-Indigenous educators and practitioners will determine how we take up the insights and integrate them into our practices. Regardless of who we are, a decolonial pedagogy is a moral call and a contemporary cultural imperative. It asks us to be critical of inequity and injustice, to learn from tribal wisdom, and to take action to relieve suffering. A decolonial pedagogy will ensure that we not only talk the talk of social justice, but that we lace up our metaphorical moccasins and walk the talk as well.</p>

                    <p>The Canadian Association of Social Workers (CASW) Code of Ethics (2005) and the companion document Guidelines for Ethical Practice provide guidance on ethical practice in social work. The Code of Ethics outlines six key values: (1) respect for the inherent dignity and worth of persons; (2) pursuit of social justice; (3) service to humanity; (4) integrity of professional practice; (5) confidentiality in professional practice; and (6) competence in professional practice. To clarify the interpretation and application of these values, the Guidelines outline in further detail the ethical responsibilities related to clients, colleagues, the profession, and society, plus ethical conduct in the workplace, in private practice, and in research settings.</p>
                    <p>Social workers must occasionally balance urgent and practical intervention measures with ethical or “political” considerations. In many cases the code of ethics and agency policy align. However, sometimes social workers confront situations in which the policy and regulations of the agency conflict with what they, as experienced social workers, see as being in the best interests of their client. As well, the standards and ethics of the profession may be inconsistent with the established procedures and practices of a particular agency. Balancing one’s beliefs, professional standards, and agency rules can be difficult. In this context, the social worker’s place of employment can be either a source of empowerment or a source of strain.</p>

In accordance with this approach, the following five questions may help in ethical decision making:</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Ethical Decision Making Related to Social Work</p>
                    <p>Ethical dilemmas often arise, for example, in income support and child welfare cases. Based on their assessment, social workers often refer clients to particular services for which they qualify. However, part of the mandate of social welfare organizations is to spend public money wisely. Therefore, social workers must ensure that the client is genuinely in need and eligible for assistance, while representing the client’s interests as fairly as possible. Striking a balance is often easier said than done. Similarly, in child welfare cases (where a child welfare worker is expected to act in the best interests of the child), the social worker may be criticized for leaving a child in a home or for taking the child away from a family prematurely. Such dilemmas are aggravated when large caseloads or tight budgets make it difficult for social workers to provide services in ways that are consistent with their professional and personal beliefs.</p>
                    <p>Social workers confront ethical issues on a daily basis. For example, a client may present a gift to show their appreciation. Or, they may disclose something that is questionable under the law. A social worker may be legally obliged to pursue a course of action (e.g., with respect to privacy and access to information). Here is a five-step process for ethical decision making:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">(1) Identify the key ethical issues in the situation.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">(2) Identify the relevant ethical guidelines within your province’s or territory’s social work code of ethics or any employer-based ethical guidelines.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">(3) Identify which ethical principles are of major importance in this particular situation and which are not. This is the rational and straightforward part of the process.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">(4) Acknowledge and examine your own emotions and values. This is where virtue-based ethical decision making may be helpful.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">(5) Outline an action plan that is appropriate for the situation at hand.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Ethical decision making becomes easier when social workers consult with colleagues, supervisors, or professional associations for assistance and support in working through the dilemma.</li>

                                        <p>The last two decades have seen an immense expansion in the number of young professionals using social media to stay informed and connected. Social workers are increasingly using electronic technology in their practice. At the practitioner level, email and Internet-mediated direct practice is ubiquitous, and sources of information for evidence-based practice are easily accessed online. At the agency level, software programs are used for service planning and delivery and for case management reporting (NASW, 2005). Technology has changed the ways in which social workers respond to the demands of practice in virtually every area of the profession.</p>
                                        <p>Social media sites provide many benefits to the service user and the global community. Benefits include sharing information and resources with a wider audience at a low cost, community building, research promotion, and imparting ideas and expertise on issues that impact health and well-being (CASW, 2014). However, there are also risks and challenges that require social workers to assess both their personal and professional use of digital technology with a critical eye.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Technology and Learning</p>
                                        <p>Today, instructors’ efforts to prepare students to engage in social work practice include the appropriate use of social media within their work contexts. Young professionals learn how online encounters and communication might influence and shape future face-to-face encounters.</p>
                                        <p>The incorporation of the ethical use of social media is an evolving topic in social work education. One example is provided by Dr. Tarsem Singh Cooner at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, who incorporates an enquiry-based blended learning design into the university’s social work curriculum. Students explore issues such as online safety; projecting and maintaining a professional online image; maintaining personal and professional boundaries; using social networks to develop and share effective professional practice; and working for the benefit of future service users. Cooner has also developed a mobile phone/tablet app to help social workers explore how to navigate the ethical issues inherent in using social media in social work.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-27" class="ch-link">Other examples of integrating digital literacy skills in the classroom include creating collaborative digital stories to explore social justice, oppression, and diversity (Walsh, Shier, Sitter, and Sieppert, 2010).</a> Still other examples include developing blended advocacy strategies that combine online applications such as Facebook posts and Vine with face-to-face engagements (Sitter, 2015). (Vine is a short-form video-sharing service that allows users to share looping video clips lasting six seconds. American microblogging website Twitter acquired Vine in October 2012, just before its official launch. By the end of 2015, Vine had 200 million active users.)</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Media in University Settings</p>
                                        <p>The term “participatory media” refers to visual, mobile, and social media applications and platforms in which the audience plays an active role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating content. Participatory media are increasingly being used in classrooms, practice settings, and schools of social work, resulting in the increased development of social media policies in university settings. All social work students should ensure familiarity with and an understanding of their university’s technology policies.</p>
                                        <p>As students move toward professional practice, beginning in the classroom and continuing in their practicums, it is important for them to think critically about professional–personal boundaries, self-disclosure, dual and multiple relationships, privacy, and conflict of interest (Johns, 2012). Social work students, faculty members, and social workers are individuals with private lives. However, off-duty conduct matters and may have a bearing on social workers’ professional lives and, in some cases, on how fit they are to graduate or to practise. As social media are intricately integrated into our daily lives, social work students and professionals may possess a false sense of online security and privacy. Early in their career, professionals may not recognize the potentially unintended audience or the permanency of the information they share (Fang et al., 2014).</p>
                                        <p>Multiple examples of the impact of personal behaviour on career potential have been portrayed in the media (e.g., Dalhousie University dentistry students who participated in posting misogynistic Facebook entries) and at universities (e.g., students violating another student’s privacy by making a video of a presentation without consent, or students posting information about practicum placements on Facebook). Public figures and politicians have been exposed on the basis of photographs taken of them or speeches they made many years ago, for which they are held accountable in the present.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Ethical Use of Digital Technology in Social Work</p>
                                        <p>Online self-help support groups have been available since the early 1980s, and today online counselling services, chat counselling, video counselling, and cyber therapy using 3-D avatars are readily available. Social workers have a responsibility to use technology proficiently and to assess the advantages and disadvantages of practising technology-based social work. Ethical practice aimed at protecting vulnerable clients and upholding the values of the profession is required for electronic and online communication, just as it is required for face-to-face interactions (ACSW, 2013). Key ethical issues that arise when using any electronic technology are client privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, conflict of interest, boundaries, consultation and client referral, termination and interruption of services, documentation, and research evidence (Reamer, 2013). Increasingly, provincial Colleges of Social Workers are developing standards of practice to govern the ethical use of technology.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Personal Is Public</p>
                                        <p>Fang, Mishna, Zhang, Van Wert, and Bogo (2014) coined the term “the personal is public,” referring to the lack of separation between our online and offline selves. “Personal” posts may be neither private nor secure. Anyone can pull up a post, and bystanders can click the “Like” button or other emoticon or comment on the post, thus inadvertently creating an increasingly public forum for the initial post. As Fang et al. (2014) illustrate in their case examples, a student might make a derogatory comment about another student, a social work colleague, or an instructor, which the targeted person can view when “mutual friends” participate in the post string, and the situation can escalate. Just as worrisome are those observers who silently endorse the post regardless of hateful or oppressive comments. These bystanders are witnesses to bullying behaviour, similar to that of children in a schoolyard.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Implications for Social Work Practice</p>
                                        <p>Opportunities abound to act as leaders in the emerging use of digital and social media literacies in practice contexts. While participatory media do not afford a magical solution in confronting problems in our work, it is a tool that can serve to amplify clients’ voices, mobilize support, and foster connections that transfer knowledge both online and offline.</p>
                                        <p>Digital technology requires thoughtful consideration of its strengths and limitations. We need to move beyond our fear of the unknown and look at the potential of technology to support the individuals, groups, and communities we work&#160;alongside.</p>

                    <p>Individuals are attracted to social work for many different reasons. Some are motivated by altruism—a desire to do good for others—often associated with personal experiences (positive or negative). Others are guided by professional or political motivations. Some wish to work in a field where they can advocate for the rights of marginalized individuals and groups.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the increasing emphasis on managerialism (or what might be called “the social control” aspect of social work) means that many social work practitioners experience a mismatch between initial good intentions and real-life experience. Stevens et al. (2012) proposed that this “mismatch that may be one factor leading to the high stress and burnout levels found in social workers” (p. 33). Carey (2008) found that although employment opportunities remained good for social workers, “morale among the majority of employees was poor” (p.&#160;90). He stated that “there was also a feeling among staff that social work was becoming devalued as a profession, and respondents identified a stronger sense of job insecurity and loss of autonomy (particularly when working with other professionals)” (p. 90).</p>
                    <p>A study of 175 social workers employed by the Children’s Aid Society of Toronto in 2004 revealed that 82.7 percent of workers reported that they had been exposed to at least one critical incident at work (including the death of a client, threats, or assault). Seventy percent reported experiencing stress as a result of a critical incident.</p>

                    <p>Other studies have found higher levels of job satisfaction. Rural and remote northern practice in Canada has long been a starting point for many social work professionals. Although they may be recruited to the North for job opportunities, many (although not all) decide to stay because of job satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Graham and colleagues (2012) note that challenges of social practice in the North include isolation, personal-professional conflicts, or practice training that conflicts with Indigenous ways of knowing. In his study of 91 social workers in the Northwest Territories and northwestern Ontario, he found general satisfaction with their work and professional roles. Interestingly, working in child welfare (typically associated with high stress levels in southern, urban centres) was found to be a predictor of satisfaction with work and profession in the north. The authors suggested that “community size creates a context which might determine or impact key socio-cultural and socio-political interactions within the social environment, which then in turn impacts practitioner well-being.”</p>
                    <p>It is sometimes argued that social workers must try to “desensitize” themselves when they work in the child welfare field. Of course, in practice this is nearly impossible. To do their jobs effectively, social workers must be sensitive to the needs and feelings of the children and families with whom they are involved. This level of commitment and engagement may be the key to their success in this difficult area of practice.</p>
                    <p>One way to offset stress and enhance job satisfaction is to engage in professional development activities among colleagues, especially those from different regions of the country. The feeling of being part of a large and diverse community of gifted professionals, which comes from attending conferences, workshops, and webinars where ideas are exchanged and effective practice strategies are shared, can be energizing. The ongoing learning and friendships that emerge from collegial interactions can help sustain one’s dedication to the job.</p>

                    <p>Social work is a noble profession to be sure, but a disconcerting phenomenon in this field has received considerable attention—the extent of worker burnout among dedicated social workers. As “burnout” can happen to anyone in a stressful occupation, it may be more accurate in the social work context to refer to such a phenomenon as “vicarious trauma” or “compassion fatigue.”</p>
                    <p>The term “compassion fatigue”refers to the anxiety resulting from dealing with emotionally difficult cases under increased workplace pressure and increased workloads. This type of stress occurs among social workers and others who are faced with increasing responsibility and less and less control over how the work is to be completed.</p>
                    <p><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-12">Self-care </span>is an important and integral part of the profession of social work. There are multiple ways to practice self-care; however, the ABC mnemonic is an easy way to remember the steps necessary toward effective self-care practices:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Awareness. </span>This involves knowing yourself, your needs, and your limits. Knowing your coping mechanisms (both healthy and unhealthy) and your triggers will assist you in applying coping techniques and identifying your triggers in your practice.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Balance and boundaries. </span>This involves finding a balance between work, play, rest, and home activities, and enjoying set times each day during which you detach yourself from work.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Consultation and connection. </span>When you are in doubt about a troubling issue or case, consult with colleagues, supervisors, and/or other supports available to you.</li>

                            <p>The values and insights imparted by an inspiring mentor during Dennis McDermott&rsquo;s university studies helped him attain his goal of working in the community health sector.</p>
                            <p>Although I had decided to enter a social work program after I completed high school, it was not until the third year of my undergraduate program that I decided I wanted to be a full-fledged practising social worker.</p>
                            <p>Because I come from a family of health-care providers, volunteerism and community involvement have always been important to me. I initially entered the social work bachelor&rsquo;s degree program to learn more about social justice and how I might advocate for change to systems of social oppression. Previously, I had worked at group homes, shelters, and recreation centres to expand my understanding. However, I sometimes felt disheartened at the steepness of the hills that are often faced by people: poverty, ableism, racism, gender discrimination, and many others.</p>
                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Valuable Lessons</p>
                            <p>In my final year of university, I was mentored by a wonderful and highly experienced supervisor during a job placement. He instilled in me the values that I cherish today. He taught his students that we should work to be good people first and foremost and that this would carry over into our practice. He taught us that sometimes the only choices we have are the hard ones, but that we still have to choose. Finally, he taught us that we should give the same amount of care, compassion, and consideration to each client, realizing that although we may not reach everyone, we will at the very least reach someone.</p>
                            <p>I was fortunate to earn money while studying. Through summer jobs working with children, people with disabilities, and residents of homeless shelters, I accumulated a solid experience base from which to transition into the workaday world. I sought out different positions in both clinical and community settings in various fields, ranging from disabilities to mental health and substance use. Many of these jobs were short-term contracts, such as relief or maternity leave positions. But they assisted me in eventually achieving my goal of working full-time in the community health sector.</p>
                            <p>I currently work as a Family Support Worker (FSW) for the Family Association for Mental Health Everywhere (FAME). I have been with FAME for just under two years. I provide education, counselling, and advocacy for families caring for a loved one with a mental health challenge. Much of what I do involves community outreach, workshops, and liaising with other community organizations for the benefit of families. The FSW position requires a well-rounded education and an up-to-date knowledge base in terms of therapies, laws, and programs for the benefit of our clientele. I searched for quite a while to find a position like the one I now hold, and after years of pursuing my goal, I am happy to be doing the work that I do.</p>
                            <p>There are multiple oppressive factors that challenge the families with whom I work. In a large urban centre, many families and their loved ones experience a high degree of poverty, homelessness, and substance use disorder. A large population of individuals requiring care, in the midst of such complex issues, poses many challenges for myself and service providers throughout the city. It is important to try to balance my own needs with the amount of time, care, and focus that I give to each client, so I can provide effective service.</p>
                            <p>The most important part of building trust and a strong rapport with my clients is to maintain a practice of open discourse. Many of the clients I have met over the years have felt a distressing lack of control over their own circumstances. Acting in ways that imply that we as practitioners are in charge of our clients&rsquo; life decisions and ultimate stability can be disempowering for them. Therefore, establishing openness and equality in my relationships with clients creates a sense of trust, so that, despite everything, they know I support them fully as they discover how to regain control over their own lives.</p>

                        <li>This chapter describes different views of the role of social welfare in our society (residual, institutional, structural). Which “position” do you feel least comfortable with? Discuss your ideas with another student and write a statement explaining why this approach is inadequate.</li>
                        <li>In 2005 the CASW formulated a new Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Ethical Practice. The 1994 code contained the philosophical statement that social work is founded on humanitarian and equalitarian ideals. Do you think the new code provides a vision of an ideal society for social work to pursue? Explain your answer.</li>
                        <li>Select one digital technology related to social work practice that you find promising in terms of advancing a social cause or causes, and explain how you think it enhances advocacy.</li>
                        <li>Empowerment is often mentioned within the context of social work practice. Write a two-page paper on the concept of empowerment and how a social worker might apply an empowerment perspective when working with individuals and families.</li>
