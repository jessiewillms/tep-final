    <p>Canada currently has no national <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-1">child welfare system</span> to address the needs of disadvantaged children. Child welfare is highly regulated across the country, however, through provincial and territorial laws and regulations. Each province and territory assumes responsibility for its children and youth and has different organizations and legislation governing their welfare. For example, there are 53 separate child welfare agencies in Ontario alone. In addition, First Nations child welfare services are provided by the provincial agency, by a First Nations agency delegated by the provincial authority, or directly by First Nations agencies as negotiated under the federal government&rsquo;s policy on Aboriginal self-government.</p>

    <p>Child welfare is a major area of employment for social workers. In 2008, just under one quarter of a million Canadian children (a rate of 38 per 1000 children) were investigated by child welfare agencies due to child protection concerns. Of those investigations, approximately 8&#160;percent (a rate of 3 per 1000 children) resulted in a change of residence for the child (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2010).</p>

    <p>This field is also one of the most difficult areas for practitioners because of the heart-wrenching cases that can arise and the often-complex moral, legal, and ethical issues involved. The work of child welfare practitioners involves much more than simply removing children from unsafe home environments. Provincial services for children and youth, provided by a branch of the provincial government or by a private or non-profit agency, involve six key activities:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Child and family investigation.</span> Protecting children at risk of abuse and neglect by investigating their family&rsquo;s capacity to ensure a safe environment for them</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Family support.</span> Providing a range of family programs and services in order to maintain healthy families, support families at risk, and protect children</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Child placement.</span> Finding temporary substitute care, such as kinship care, foster care, and group homes, for children who cannot continue to live with their parent(s) or guardian(s)</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Foster care.</span> Recruiting foster-care providers and providing training and support, as well as monitoring foster homes</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Guardianship.</span> Delivering services to children who are in government care on a long-term or continuing basis</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Adoption.</span> Finding permanent homes for children who cannot live with their biological or legal parents</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Acting in these many ways through provincial agencies and non-profit centres, social workers and child welfare advocates support and intervene on behalf of children and their families.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Comprehensive Social Services for Children and Youth</p>

    <p>The services that social workers provide for children and youth can be either &ldquo;in-home&rdquo; or &ldquo;out-of-home.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-141" class="ch-link">Evidence-Based Child Welfare Practice</a></p>

    <p> As explained in Chapter 4, <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-4">evidence-based practice</span> (or evidence-informed practice) refers to a process designed to ensure that social work interventions have the best possible outcomes and benefit the greatest number of people. Practitioners combine the latest research with their own experiences and client preferences to help guide service provision.</p>

    <p>In an attempt to group and classify factors that might have an impact on service provision, Regehr, Stern, and Shlonsky (2007) outlined a practice model in relation to child welfare (shown in Figure 5.1 below). It takes into account not only the immediate situation of the client, but also the wider community, the social services agency itself, and the larger political context.</p>

    <p>For example, Fallon and Trocm&eacute; (2011) examined the CIS-1998 data on how social workers&rsquo; characteristics contributed to the provision of services. Some of the findings were:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item">Metropolitan agencies provided ongoing services to 27&#8239;percent of cases (the lowest proportion), whereas rural agencies provided ongoing services to 45 percent of cases.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">Investigations involving workers with a generic caseload had a higher rate of ongoing services (46 percent) than those with only intake responsibilities (29 percent).</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">Investigations by workers who had either a B.S.W. or M.S.W. had a lower rate of ongoing service provision (31 percent) compared to workers who did not (38 percent).</li>
    

    	<li>The characteristics of the social worker had little effect on decision making; however, workers&rsquo; attitudes made a difference&mdash;those who were &ldquo;pro-removal&rdquo; rated risk more highly and were more likely to recommend removal than those who were &ldquo;anti-removal.&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>

        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

    <p>Each province and territory in Canada now has a well-established system of child welfare services to prevent or help remedy problems that may cause children to be neglected, abused, exploited, or in trouble with the law. For much of our history, however, children were often regarded as chattel to be bought, sold, or even put to death. The evolution of child welfare demonstrates a radical shift in societal views of children. Once treated as property or a source of cheap labour, children are now seen as valuable human beings entitled to legislated rights and protection.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Pre-Industrial Child Welfare&mdash;Pre-1890</p>

    <p>The problems of child abuse and neglect did not suddenly appear in the twentieth century. The children of rural settler families in British North America typically worked at farming alongside other family members, and a strict division of labour was enforced. The mother was responsible for family-care needs, such as cooking, cleaning, and nursing, while the father was responsible for the family&rsquo;s economic survival needs. The wife and children existed as dependants of the family patriarch. Patriarchal authority was reinforced through a variety of state laws and practices.</p>

    <p>By contrast, Indigenous communities had rather more inclusive ideas concerning children. Most Indigenous peoples of Canada believe that a child belongs to his or her people, and that a child is a gift from the Creator. They believe that this connection of child to community is non-discretionary&mdash;it is the responsibility of all to meet the child&rsquo;s needs.</p>

    <p>In 1792, the Province of Upper Canada proclaimed that the Common Law of England would be enforced in the new province. This law was exceedingly harsh toward children. Then, in 1799, Upper Canada introduced the first act concerning children. Known as the Orphans Act, it gave town wardens the power to bind a child under 14 to an employer as an apprentice. In 1827, this act was replaced with the Guardianship Act, which allowed guardians appointed by the court to bind the child as an apprentice. Poor families were viewed as moral and economic threats, and to avoid tainting the children of such families with parental failure, the children were &ldquo;bound out&rdquo; to proper self-supporting families.</p>

    <p>The period from 1867 to 1890 saw new laws that began to change the exalted position of husbands and fathers, but times remained difficult for children and women. The legislative right of men to inflict arbitrary and severe punishment on their wives and children was beginning to be challenged. In 1874, Ontario introduced compulsory education, the regulation of work hours, the right of women to hold property, and the rise of new and improved social agencies. For the first time, courts would decide whether a child&rsquo;s best interests would be better served with his or her family, one parent, or an employer. Until this time, however, children generally were not seen as needing special care or nurturing. In fact, their needs were often ignored.</p>

    <p>This period also saw the beginning of a campaign to assimilate Indigenous children into mainstream Canadian society. The Indian Act (1876) exemplified the colonizers&rsquo; views toward First Nations and their children. Besides outlawing traditional ceremonies, such as the potlatch, the laws attempted to eradicate Indigenous cultures by taking children out of First Nations homes and communities and placing them in residential schools. These schools were administered by Christian churches in association with the government. (For more on residential schools, see Chapter 9.)</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-144" class="ch-link">Child Welfare Legislation&shy; in the Late 1890s and Early 1900s</a></p>

    <p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there was a marked increase in government involvement in children&rsquo;s issues. In particular, federal and provincial legislation was enacted that allowed the state to remove children from the care of their parents or guardians. The federal Juvenile Delinquent Act of 1908 and the Ontario Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children of 1893 were both aimed at the protection of children. The legal mandate for promoting the &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; of children was given to the state, and the state could decide whether parents were good or bad. It had the authority (through legislation and the courts) to remove children from homes and place them in care.</p>

    <p>In the 1890s, Canadian provinces began to establish commissions to inspect the working conditions for children in factories. Many children as young as eight and nine years of age were employed, and inspections often revealed a callous disregard for the welfare of these children by factory owners. For example, there were repeated reports of poor ventilation and a lack of sanitary equipment. As well, the children were receiving no education while working in the factories, which contributed to the large number of illiterate adults across the country. As a result, new legislation was passed to regulate working conditions and hours of work. Eventually, the age at which one was no longer considered a child was raised to 16.</p>

    <p>The passing of the 1893 Children&rsquo;s Protection Act in Ontario ushered in a new era of child welfare legislation protecting children from abuse and neglect. For example, a child found sleeping in the open air was now considered to be neglected. Those found guilty of mistreating a child were sentenced to three months of hard labour. The idea of foster homes, supervised by Children&rsquo;s Aid Societies, also originated with this act. In 1908, the Child Welfare Act provided for procedures to rehabilitate mistreated children. Between 1891 and 1912, sixty Children&rsquo;s Aid Societies sprang up in Ontario. In 1912, they amalgamated and are now known as the Ontario Association of Children&rsquo;s Aid Societies (OACAS). In other provinces as well, a new idea began to crystallize about the obligation of society to protect children. Following the lead of Ontario&rsquo;s first child protection law in 1893, other provinces developed laws and practices based on the doctrine of parens patriae (parent of the nation).</p>

            <p class="text--caption">Québec was the last province to develop child welfare legislation: in 1977 the Youth Protection Act (YPA) was passed to govern the child welfare system. Until then, responsibility for child protection in Québec had resided with the Catholic Church. French Civil Law, the governing tradition in Québec, gave the Church the power to step in when parents failed. Thus, Québec did not initiate child protection as a separate provincial service until 1933, and the Church’s influence on child welfare was strong up until the early 1960s.</p>
            <p class="text--caption">The YPA defines the range of situations that can endanger a child’s safety or development to the point where intervention is required. The YPA also specifies that all citizens, and especially professionals who work with children, are responsible for reporting suspected child maltreatment to a Director of Youth Protection (DYP).</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Role of Women&rsquo;s Organizations in Furthering Children&rsquo;s Protection</p>

    <p>Several important women&rsquo;s organizations emerged in the late nineteenth century that affected the rights of children. These organizations played an important role in the development of child and family welfare in this country, not to mention the status of women.</p>

    <p>The Women&rsquo;s Missionary Societies that had formed in most Canadian churches in the 1870s and 1880s began addressing the needs of women and children. The Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, established in 1874, originally emphasized the prohibition of the sale of alcohol, but broadened its social goals to helping children. This included ensuring child protection, establishing reformatories for juveniles, and building cottage-style homes to replace institutional care facilities. The Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association (YWCA) addressed the needs of urban working women, including assisting them with their children.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the National Council of Women, formed in 1893 as an alliance of women&rsquo;s organizations aimed at coordinating policies at a national level, considered many women&rsquo;s issues to be &ldquo;mothering&rdquo; issues, and their goal was to bring private mothering practices to public and national attention.</p>

    <p>Describing the evolution of child welfare legislation and practice in Canada is complicated because each province and territory has individual jurisdictional responsibility for the well-being of children, and no national framework for child welfare exists.</p>

    <p>In general, however, child welfare was originally entrenched in a child-saving paradigm&mdash;that is, in the perceived need to rescue children from abusive and neglectful parents. This approach was based on principles related to investigation by an agency and resulted in the provision of either meagre support for &ldquo;deserving parents&rdquo; or foster care for children whose parents were deemed unfit (Swift, 2011: 40). Exceptions occurred in Qu&eacute;bec, where the Catholic Church was relied upon to step in when parents could not care for their children, and for Aboriginal children, where the primary form of &ldquo;child protection&rdquo; was residential schools.</p>

    <p>By the 1920s, however, a new notion of &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; was emerging. The idea that family care, even flawed family care, was better than institutional care, and that a natural family was better than a foster family, took hold. In 1927, Charlotte Whitton&rsquo;s seminal report on child welfare in British Columbia painted a compelling picture of the negative effects of institutions on children&rsquo;s well-being. This report endorsed preventive work with families and set the stage for the training of skilled social workers.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Research-Based Revelations of the Extent of Harm Being Done to Children</p>

    <p>The post-World War II period saw an expansion of research and of empirical knowledge related to child welfare and child maltreatment in particular. American pediatrician Dr. C. Henry Kempe published a landmark article in 1962 on the <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-5">battered-child syndrome;</span> for the first time, a medical professional identified child abuse as a clinical condition. Kempe&rsquo;s paper established child abuse as a regular and recurring aspect of family life in many households rather than a sensational exception. Recognizing that children may be frightened to &ldquo;disclose&rdquo; and that parents may describe injuries as &ldquo;accidents,&rdquo; legislators developed laws that required professionals and members of the public to report suspected child abuse and neglect (Bala, 2011: 3).</p>

    <p>In 1951, the federal government amended the Indian Act, transferring responsibility for the welfare of First Nations children to provincial governments. The resulting removal of thousands of First Nations children from their families claimed national attention in 1983 in Patrick Johnston&rsquo;s Native Children and the Child Welfare System. In the book, he coined the now-commonplace term &ldquo;the Sixties Scoop.&rdquo; Although the practice of removing Aboriginal children from their families and communities had existed prior to the 1960s, this era saw an acceleration in the rate of removal and in the placement of these children, in most cases, into middle-class Euro-Canadian families. This practice eventually led to a massive over-representation of Aboriginal children in care (in 1951 , only 1 percent of children in care were Aboriginal, compared to 34 percent in 1964). The over-representation of Aboriginal children in care continues today.</p>

    <p>In 1984, the <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-6">Badgley Report</span> (so called because Robin F. Badgley was the chairman of the authoring committee) brought to light the disturbing extent of child sexual abuse in Canada. The report revealed that one out of two females and one out of three males had at some point in their lives been the victim of unwanted sexual acts, and that four out of five of these acts took place during childhood or adolescence. The report concluded that all systems for reporting sexual abuse were flawed and ineffective and that children needed considerably better protection from sexual predators.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-146" class="ch-link">New Thinking about Children and Child Welfare</a></p>

    <p>During the post-war period, hundreds of pieces of new child welfare legislation were introduced across the country, altering the way we think of children and how child welfare workers can best perform their roles. While each province passed distinct and separate pieces of legislation, several overall trends became apparent:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        
        <li class="li--bullet-item">First, there was a shift from volunteers to a more professionalized service delivery system.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">Second, provincial governments themselves began to accept direct responsibility for the delivery of child welfare services.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">Third, social work agencies began to develop and implement risk-assessment models and standardized record-keeping methods.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">Finally, there was a move from institutional and protection-oriented services to non-institutional and prevention-oriented services.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>By the end of the 1960s, the number of foster homes had begun to decline, and two alternatives to foster homes and large-scale institutions had emerged: treatment regimes for troubled children and youth were established, and group homes were launched.</p>

    <p>The shocking revelations of the extent of child abuse, along with legislation aimed at protecting vulnerable children and young people, led to important improvements in the child welfare system in Canada as the twenty-first century drew near. However, many deep-rooted structural problems, such as poverty and insufficient government funding, continued to present difficult challenges for child-welfare practitioners and advocates, as they do to this day.</p>

    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

    <p>The 1990s saw heightened media attention on the deaths of children known to child protection authorities. The most prominent of these was the death of Matthew Vaudreuil in British Columbia, which led to the 1995 Report of the Gove Inquiry into Child Protection in British Columbia (named for the report&rsquo;s commissioner, the Honourable Judge Thomas J. Gove). Emphasizing the safety of children over family support, the report recommended that a comprehensive &ldquo;risk-assessment&rdquo; approach be adopted by child protection agencies. The report instigated an overhaul of the child protection system in British Columbia.</p>

    <p>Those changes were replicated across the country. In Ontario, similar reviews occurred in the late 1990s, resulting in new legislation and the implementation of risk-assessment tools designed to prevent harm to children. By 2002, eight Canadian provinces had adopted some form of risk-assessment tool (Swift, 2011: 52).</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Risk-Assessment Models</p>

    <p>Models for <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-7">risk assessment</span> estimate the likelihood that a child will be maltreated and, if a harmful event should occur, the potential severity of that harm. Child protection authorities hoped that the implementation of standardized risk-assessment models would promote more reliable, more accurate, and less biased decision making related to child welfare (Hughes and Rycus, 2007). Although these models purport to have a research base that correlates risk factors with the abuse and neglect of children, they vary greatly in their scope and purpose, with differing weights assigned to the various risk factors. While it is true that the risk factors identified in most of the risk-assessment systems are associated with child maltreatment, &ldquo;causality has not been established&rdquo; (Krane and Davies,&#160;2000:&#160;37).</p>

    <p>Importantly, risk-assessment approaches were never intended to be used in isolation from clinical judgment and expertise; they were intended to complement these, not replace them. Over time, however, the approaches became increasingly bureaucratic and used as technocratic tools that child welfare authorities relied upon to address the apparent problem of accountability in the child welfare system. Many opponents of risk-assessment approaches argued that in practice, these approaches contributed to the erosion of professional practice in favour of managerialism (Callahan and Swift, 2007).</p>

    <p>By the turn of the twenty-first century, the verdict was in. Most provinces had begun to look at alternative practice paradigms, and many began adopting a range of collaborative approaches to use alongside risk-assessment tools. Under the broad category of alternative responses, these paradigms offer two simultaneous pathways that enable social workers and child welfare agencies to protect children more effectively:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item">an investigative track that assesses safety and risk factors</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item">an assessment track that focuses on family strengths and needs, as well as on voluntary support services available to the family</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In many ways, the pendulum is swinging more visibly toward the second, family-centred model of practice, which allows for more collaborative and flexible services and responses to the needs of children and families, while encouraging all parties to seek alternatives to court disputes. Increasingly, amendments to legislation related to child and family services emphasize engaging with family and kin to strive to keep children within permanent family&#160;structures.</p>

            <p class="text--caption">Maltreated or neglected children may be afraid to disclose their abuse because they think no one will believe them. In addition, abusers frequently warn children not to tell anyone about their actions.

            <p class="text--caption">For this reason, people in professions that bring them into contact with children have a <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-8">duty to report</span> if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is, or may be, in need of protection.

    <p>Today&rsquo;s emerging <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-9">collaborative approaches</span> to child protection are based on developing constructive and positive working relationships between social work professionals and family members.

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Mediation.</span> When family members and child-welfare workers disagree on the best way to meet a child&rsquo;s needs, mediation can break the impasse.

    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-13">Child maltreatment</span> is an umbrella term referring to multiple forms of child abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment includes acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that result in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Different jurisdictions have differing definitions of child abuse, and maltreatment can take many forms. Nevertheless, child maltreatment has five broad categories:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
       <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Physical abuse</span> includes any non-accidental action that causes, or could cause, physical harm to a child, such as hitting, shaking, or the unreasonable use of force to restrain a child.</li>

       <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Sexual abuse</span> includes using a child for sexual purposes, such as through sexual contact, inappropriate exposure to sexual activity or material, or exploitation through prostitution and related activities.</li>

       <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Neglect</span> includes the failure of a parent or guardian to provide a child&rsquo;s basic needs, such as food, education, health care, or supervision.</li>

       <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Emotional maltreatment</span> includes behaviours that harm a child&rsquo;s development or sense of self-worth, such as humiliation, rejection, or withholding love or support.</li>

       <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Exposure to domestic violence</span> includes directly witnessing violence between parents or caregivers, or being indirectly exposed by hearing the violence or seeing the after-effects, such as bruising or other physical injuries. (Some provinces and territories include exposure to domestic violence under &ldquo;emotional maltreatment.&rdquo;)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Prevalence of Child Maltreatment</p>

    <p>How extensive is the problem of child maltreatment in Canada? The <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-14">Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS)</span> reports national data on the incidence of child maltreatment in Canada and has completed its third cycle of data collection. &ldquo;In 2008, an estimated 235,842 maltreatment-related investigations were conducted across Canada, representing a rate of 39.16 investigations per 1000 children&rdquo; (Public Health Agency of Canada,&#160;2010).</p>

    <p>According to the CIS, &ldquo;the two most frequently occurring categories of substantiated maltreatment were exposure to intimate partner violence (34 percent) and neglect (34 percent).&ldquo; Physical abuse was the primary concern in 20 percent of the substantiated cases, emotional maltreatment in 9 percent of substantiated investigations, and sexual abuse in 3 percent. Figure 5.3 shows the extent of substantiated child maltreatment in Canada in 2008.</p>

    <p>Of the estimated 235,842 investigations, 92 percent resulted in no out-of-home placement. Of the almost 20,000 investigations that did result in a child&rsquo;s change of residence, 4 percent resulted in an informal arrangement with a relative, 4 percent resulted in a move to foster or kinship care, and fewer than 1 percent resulted in a move to a group home or residential/secure treatment.</p>

    <p>In an Ontario-specific CIS report published in 2013, it was revealed that 125,281 investigations were conducted in the province that year (a rate of 53.32 per 1000 children); 78 percent of these were maltreatment investigations that focused on a concern of abuse or neglect (an estimated 97,951 investigations, or 41.69 per 1000 children) and 22 percent of the investigations were based on concerns about the risk of future maltreatment (an estimated 27,330 investigations, or 11.63 per 1000 children) (Fallon et al, 2013).</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-151" class="ch-link">Child Neglect: The Least Understood Form of Maltreatment</a></p>

    <p>Child neglect is a major social problem and the most pervasive form of child maltreatment in high-resource Anglophone countries such as Canada. Approximately one third of all substantiated cases of child maltreatment in Canada are due to child neglect. Whereas reported rates of physical and sexual abuse have declined over the last two decades, the rate of child neglect has remained fairly constant.</p>

    <p>Child neglect is the least understood form of child maltreatment. In part, this reflects differing definitions and understandings of the term child neglect. However, the consequences for children who are neglected are well documented and are as severe as those associated with physical and sexual abuse. These include the child not meeting developmental milestones, poorer school achievement, increased problems with attachment and subsequent personality disorders, and increased internalizing behaviours (withdrawal, anxiety, and depression). Neglect is the form of child maltreatment that is most likely to require medical treatment and that is most associated with child fatality. Child neglect also often occurs alongside other forms of maltreatment.</p>

    <p>Cases of child neglect are notoriously difficult to resolve. Once a case of child neglect has been assessed by child welfare authorities, the response is complex and requires more interventions than other forms of maltreatment. Once closed, a case of child neglect is more likely to be re-opened, compared with cases of physical or sexual abuse. This chronic opening, closing, re-opening, and re-assessing of cases&mdash;through a succession of social workers and foster home placements&mdash;contributes to poor outcomes for children who are experiencing neglect.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Aboriginal children in Canada are over-represented in out-of-home care—making up just 15 percent of the total child population, but 40 percent of children in care.</p>

	<p>The number of investigations into the maltreatment of Aboriginal children is more than four times higher than those involving non-Aboriginal children. Furthermore, over-representation occurs at all stages of these investigations: Aboriginal families are more likely to be investigated, cases are more likely to be substantiated, and children are more likely to be removed from the home. As well, once a file is opened, it is also more likely to stay open.</p>

	<p>The First Nations component of the Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (Sinha, Ellenbogen, and Trocmé, 2013) analyzed child protection information for First Nations children. It showed that First Nations famiiles were disproportionately investigated for all forms of child maltreatment—twice as frequently for physical abuse and three times as often for sexual abuse. The highest disproportionality was in situations of suspected neglect. First Nations children were the focus of investigations for neglect six times more often than non-Aboriginal children.</p>

	<p>Sinha, Ellenbogen, and Trocmé (2013) examined caregiver and household risk factors associated with the investigation and substantiation of child neglect among First Nations families. They found that the most commonly identified risk factors for First Nations children were substance abuse, domestic violence, and a lack of social supports. The most commonly identified risk factor concerns were low income and caregiving &#160;resource strain.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Systemic Risks</p>

	<p>The persistent over-representation of Aboriginal famillies in investigations of child maltreatment cannot be adequately understood through the dominant individual and forensic perspectives. It can be tied to the low incomes and poor housing conditions of many First Nations families (Sinha, Trocmé, Blackstock, MacLaurin, and Fallon, 2011), and is exacerbated by social issues of substance use and domestic violence. These issues are structural factors that “place children and families at risk [and] that are largely beyond their ability to control” (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2013).</p>

	<p>Some of these systemic risks are related to federal and provincial jurisdictional disputes, the underfunding of services on reserves, and a failure to provide adequate resources for family support programs (Sinha, Trocmé, Blackstock, MacLaurin, and Fallon, 2011).</p>

	<p>Aboriginal overrepresentation in child abuse and neglect investigations can also be linked to historical practices, in particular, the period of the “Sixties Scoop” and the placement of First Nations children in residential schools.</p>

	<p>Recently, there have been changes to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada’s Directive 20-1 to shift funding models away from in-care options to programs and supports that help First Nations families keep their children at or closer to home. But the systemic risks must also be addressed.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Structural Interventions</p>

	<p>Blackstock et al. (2006) make the point that it is important for child-welfare workers to differentiate between family risk and structural risk, and to respond meaningfully to both. The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (Martel,&#160;2013) has identified some promising structural interventions and practices:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Housing.</span> Inadequate housing is a structural risk factor often correlated with poverty. Safe housing is often not accessible (e.g., there is often overcrowding, a lack of clean drinking water, and mould in First Nations housing on-reserve). Developing safe and affordable housing options and/or connecting clients to housing option resources are structural interventions that mitigate the unnecessary removal of a child from the family home. An example is the Native Child and Family Services of Toronto (NCFST), which offers apartments to women and children up to the age of 16 for a stay of up to 18 months. Support services augment the housing stability.</li>

		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Substance use.</span> Substance use is a significant contributory risk factor. In order to protect the health and well-being of families and to prevent child maltreatment, substance misuse services must be available and accessible to families. This requires improving training and awareness, as well as collaboration to ensure that substance misuse workers and child welfare workers act together to meet the needs of children and their families. Understanding Substance Abuse and Facilitating Recovery: A Guide for Child Welfare Workers (Breshears, Yeh, and Young, 2009) is a useful resource outlining tools and skills to support child safety in the context of substance misuse.</li>
		
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Poverty.</span> Poverty is the leading structural risk factor associated with the removal of all children, and particularly First Nations children. The employment rate and employment income rate for Aboriginal people are substantially lower than for non-Aboriginal people. Improving Canadian child tax benefits and employment opportunities are pathways to reducing this structural inequity.</li>

    <p>If a child protection agency or a court decides that maltreatment of a child has been substantiated, substitute care may be required. Taking children into care is typically seen as a last-resort measure in cases where the risk to the child is assessed to be significant. However, if substitute care becomes necessary, and since &ldquo;family&rdquo; is seen as the ideal setting for childrearing in the Western world, foster care is normally the &ldquo;placement of choice&rdquo; for younger children who are deemed to be in need of substitute care (Kufeldt, 2011: 157). For older children, the placement of choice is a group home.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Foster Care</p>

    <p><span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-15">Foster homes</span> provide substitute parenting for children who cannot safely stay with their own families, for children whose families have asked for help with parenting during times of crisis, or for children whose families need specific or periodic help in caring for their children. In the foster home, the child is entitled to receive</p>
    
    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item">physical care, such as clothing, food, and shelter;</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item">emotional care, including love and inclusion in family events;</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item">nurturing of both intellectual and emotional development;</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item">guidance and supervision; and</li>
        <li class="li--bullet-item">positive role modelling.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Placement in a good family, combined with sound social work services, are key factors leading to positive foster care experiences. Factors that contribute to negative outcomes include frequent changes in placement (and subsequent changes in school), intensive damage associated with early experiences in the family of origin (which affect education and social relations), and little attention paid by social workers to the importance of family contact.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Group Homes</p>

    <p>Despite a significant decrease in residential care for children and youth since the 1970s, most jurisdictions continue to provide at least a minimal number of <span class="text--red span--keyword" id="kc-16">group homes.</span> Staffed group care residences accommodating generally between two and eight young people are preferable to large institutions.</p>

    <p>In response to scathing critiques and revelations of institutional abuse, Anglin (2011 ) undertook a research study to construct a theoretical framework for well-functioning group homes. Three interwoven threads emerged as important psychosocial factors in determining whether a young person&rsquo;s experience in a group home is positive or negative:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Creating an extrafamilial environment</span> relates to the overall development and ongoing operation of a group home. Group homes strive to create a home-like environment while removing the intimacy and intensity of a family environment.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Responding to pain and pain-based behaviour</span> is a primary challenge for care workers. So-called &ldquo;acting out&rdquo; behaviours and internalizing processes, such as depression, are frequently the result of internalized pain and traumatic personal backgrounds.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Developing a sense of normality</span> within the &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; living environment of a group home provides a bridging experience in terms of the resident&rsquo;s readiness to engage successfully in more normative environments.</li>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-155" class="ch-link">The Need to Monitor the Quality of Out-of-Home Care</a></p>

    <p>As remarkable as it may seem, over 200,000 children and youth come into contact with child welfare authorities every year in Canada, and on any given day of the year, over 67,000 children and youth are living in out-of-home care. Although this is clearly one of the most high-risk groups of children in Canada, there is no accepted framework for tracking how well they are doing. In an effort to address this issue, Nico Trocm&eacute; and his colleagues put forward an &ldquo;outcomes matrix&rdquo; that can be used by child welfare managers and policy makers to track trends and evaluate programs and policies (Trocm&eacute; et al., 2009).</p>

    <p>The National Child Welfare Outcomes Indicator Matrix (NOM) was developed through a series of consultations initiated by the Provincial and Territorial Directors of Child Welfare and Human Resources Development Canada. In the absence of any national benchmarks, the proposed indicators can be used to measure the degree to which child welfare services are working effectively on behalf of Canadian children and families. The NOM takes into account the balance between a child&rsquo;s immediate need for protection, a child&rsquo;s long-term need for nurturing and a stable home environment, a family&rsquo;s potential for growth, and the community&rsquo;s capacity to meet a child&rsquo;s&#160;needs.</p>

    <p>The NOM framework consists of four nested domains that capture the key indicators: the child&rsquo;s safety, the child&rsquo;s well-being, permanence, and family and community support. (See Figure&#160;5.4.) The permanence indicator tracks a child&rsquo;s out-of-home placement(s) and the number of moves made by a child who is in out-of-home care.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">“There are more First Nations children in foster care today than at the height of&#160;residential schools.”</p>

	<p>As the mandate for the inquiry on murdered and missing Indigenous women takes shape, the government ought to consider the role systemic disadvantage plays in placing women and girls at higher risk for violence.</p>

	<p>The recent revelations in Val-d’Or, Québec [allegations by Aboriginal women of assault and sexual abuse at the hands of provincial police officers], for example, suggest that racism is more prevalent than we would like to think.</p>

	<p>As a recent series in <em>The Globe and Mail</em> reported, a number of the murdered and missing women and girls were in foster care. A child-welfare system is an essential public service. On those rare occasions when parents are unable to ensure the safety and development of their children, the state must step in and provide alternative arrangements that will safeguard the interests of the children.</p>

	<p>However, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission pointed out, the system is not well-suited to the needs of Indigenous children. It does not account for the multigenerational impacts of residential schools and inequitable services on reserves. This means First Nations families have less support to care for their children than other Canadians. This entails a dramatic over-representation of First Nations children in foster care.</p>

	<p>The problem is so severe that there are more First Nations children in foster care today than at the height of residential schools. Too often, Indigenous children removed from their families are placed in non-Indigenous foster homes and experience multiple placements. When that happens, Indigenous children are not only separated from their families, but also from their culture and from their communities. Taken together, these circumstances place First Nations girls and women at greater risk for disadvantage, including violence.</p>


	<p>The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society brought a human-rights challenge against the federal government to correct the inequalities in on-reserve child welfare and give First Nations an equitable chance to care for their children. In&#160;the evidence before the tribunal, we learned that</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the federal funding formula puts an incentive on the removal of children from their families by inequitably funding family support services;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">rigidity in federal government mandates results in First Nations children being denied or delayed receipt of public services available to all other children;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">federal policy prevents the adaptation of provincial child-welfare systems to First Nations cultures and community needs; and</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">the federal government pays non-Aboriginal child-welfare providers more money than it pays First Nations to deliver the same services.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Instead of remedying the inequalities First Nations children experience, the previous federal government failed to implement evidence-based solutions to address the problems and spent at least $5 million trying to derail the human-rights case on legal technicalities.</p>

	<p>This regressive approach got in the way of implementing proven strategies to help First Nations children and families, and in doing so perpetuated the long, dark shadow of federal-government discrimination against First Nations children.</p>

	<p>Tragically, Canadian governments have not paid enough attention to the well-being of children. The KidsRights Index ranks Canada 57th in the world when it comes to respecting children’s rights in proportion to its wealth. That means the Canadian economy is doing about five times better than Canadian kids are. Saving money on the backs of kids is fool’s gold. As the World Health Organization notes, for every government dollar invested in children, taxpayers save $7 in downstream costs, such as policing, addictions, and social assistance. Thus, it makes good economic and moral sense for the federal government to end inequalities in First Nations education, health, and child welfare.</p>

	<p>When an inquiry gets underway and explores how these tragedies can be prevented, it should turn its attention to the long-standing gaps in children’s services in First Nations communities. The federal government simply can’t afford to continue to use racial discrimination as a fiscal-restraint measure. Our children deserve better.</p>

    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

    <p>As stated earlier in this chapter, poverty is the leading structural risk associated with the removal of children, especially Indigenous children, from their homes. Hunger and food insecurity, a dearth of affordable housing, and a lack of sustainable full-time employment all place enormous stress on parents and can destabilize families. In 1989, in response to this troubling reality, all Canadian political parties resolved to end child poverty in Canada by the beginning of the twenty-first century.</p>

    <p>Campaign 2000 arose as a non-partisan, cross-Canada, public education movement to build awareness and support for this all-party House of Commons resolution. The campaign began in 1991 out of concern for the lack of government progress in addressing child poverty.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Campaign&rsquo;s Primary Goals</p>

    <p>The campaign now encompasses a network of more than 120 national, provincial, and community partners. Additionally, hundreds of other groups across the country are working to advance Campaign 2000&rsquo;s goals, such as children&rsquo;s aid societies, faith organizations, community agencies, health organizations, school boards, and low-income people&rsquo;s groups. These goals include the following:</p>

    <ul class="ul--list">
        <li class="li--bullet-item">To raise and protect the basic living standards of families in all regions of the country so that no child in Canada must ever live in poverty. [Poverty is measured using Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Low-Income Cut-Off Lines (LICOs).]</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">To improve the life chances of all children in Canada to fulfill their potential and nurture their talent, and to become responsible and contributing members of Canadian society.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">To ensure the availability of secure, affordable, and suitable housing as an inherent right of all children in Canada.</li>

        <li class="li--bullet-item">To create, build, and strengthen family support, child care, and community resources to empower families to provide the best possible care for children.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">How Are We Doing?</p>

    <p>Campaign 2000&rsquo;s annual national Report Card on Child and Family Poverty in Canada measures the progress, or lack of progress, of the unanimous all-party resolution. Its Report Card on Child and Family Poverty in Canada, 2014 states: &ldquo;As Campaign 2000 issues its 23rd monitoring report, we are saddened and distressed by the abysmal lack of progress in reducing child poverty in Canada.&rdquo; Over the past 25 years, child and family poverty has actually increased to 1,331,530 children (19.1 percent) from 1,066,150 children (15.8 percent) in 1989, according to taxfiler data (see Figure 5.5).</p>

    <p>The report points out that the Canadian economy has doubled in size, yet the incomes of families in the lowest decile have stagnated. The gap between rich and poor remains extremely wide, leaving average-income families imperilled as well.</p>

    <p>What needs to happen, the report asks? One key recommendation is to increase the Canada Child Tax Benefit/National Child Benefit (CCTB/NCB) for low-income families to a maximum of $5,600 per child. This enhanced benefit, when coupled with full-time work, would enable a lone parent with one child to lift her family out of poverty. The report stresses our country&rsquo;s urgent need for decent, full-time jobs with benefits to replace low-waged, precarious, and part-time employment.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-159" class="ch-link">The Unique Situation of Indigenous Children and Their Families</a></p>

    <p>As stated earlier in this book, term &ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo; includes the three primary groups with Aboriginal rights as outlined in Canada&rsquo;s constitution: First Nations or Indian, M&eacute;tis, and Inuit. The impoverished conditions that Indigenous peoples now experience are rooted in a legacy of colonialism and harmful policies that for decades separated children from their families.</p>

    <p>Research confirms that the average child poverty rate for Indigenous children is 40 percent, in contrast to the average child poverty rate for all children, which is 17 percent. The status of Indigenous children, as well as their location, is linked to their poverty rate. One in two (50 percent) of Status First Nations children lives in poverty in a First Nations community. First Nations child-welfare agencies are chronically underfunded, despite a complaint first filed in 2007 by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations against the government of Canada at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. This complaint alleges discrimination in the provision of child and family services in First Nations communities. A landmark decision favouring this complaint was rendered by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on January 26, 2016. </p>

    <p>In its 2014 report, Campaign 2000 made two recommendations in response to the grinding poverty that remains a major barrier to well-being for Indigenous children: (1) &ldquo;a plan to prevent, reduce, and eventually eradicate family poverty in Indigenous families developed in conjunction with Indigenous organizations&rdquo;; and (2) &ldquo;a commitment by the federal government and by provinces and territories to implement <span class="text--red span--keyword">Jordan&rsquo;s Principle</span> to ensure that Indigenous children&rsquo;s needs are met expeditiously.&rdquo;</p>

        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">

    <p>In Canada, child welfare legislation and policy have been organized around two primary frameworks: child protection and family support. The former focuses on applying resources to the investigation of child maltreatment. Generally a highly legalistic and bureaucratic process, it emphasizes a social control function. A family support orientation places greater emphasis on providing early intervention and additional supports and resources to vulnerable families (Mackenzie and Shangraux, 2011: 328).</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">&ldquo;Best Interests&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Least Restrictive&rdquo; Approaches</p>

    <p>As stated previously, the &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; approach emphasizes the protection and well-being of the child, whereas the &ldquo;least restrictive&rdquo; approach emphasizes the course of action that will cause the least disruption for the child, leaving him or her with the family if possible.</p>

    <p>Deciding what is in the best interests of a child is often extremely difficult. When provinces have had &ldquo;best interests&rdquo; legislation in place, the number of children taken from their families generally increased, sometimes dramatically. A few high-profile cases in which children were harmed as a result of being left in a dangerous situation at home have led several provinces to change their &ldquo;least restrictive&rdquo; legislation. Of course, the state must also consider the emotional and spiritual damage that may be caused by removing children from their families and placing them in group homes.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">&ldquo;Urgent Protection&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Chronic Need&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The concepts of &ldquo;protection,&rdquo; &ldquo;safety,&rdquo; &ldquo;harm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;risk&rdquo; are relatively clear in the context of child sexual abuse and severe physical abuse. The meaning is less clear in relation to the predominant forms of child maltreatment&mdash;neglect, emotional maltreatment, and exposure to intimate partner violence. Clearly, child sexual and physical abuse are acts of &ldquo;commission&rdquo; associated with acute harm, and are readily observable and can be documented. Child neglect and intimate partner violence, on the other hand, are situations of &ldquo;omission,&rdquo; whereby the parent fails to provide for the child&rsquo;s needs, thus leading to long-term psychological harm (Trocm&eacute;, Kyte, Sinha, and Fallon, 2014).</p>

    <p>The distinction between urgent protection and chronic need is clear in an examination of the Canadian Incidence Study (CIS) data. The rate of &ldquo;urgent protective investigations&rdquo; (those involving severe physical injury, sexual abuse, or victims under four years of age at high risk of serious injury) has remained relatively constant, at a little over six investigations per 1000 children. In contrast, other maltreatment investigations have more than doubled, increasing from a rate of 15.39 investigations per 1000 children in 1998 to 33.13 investigations per 1000 children in 2008. As a result, the proportion of investigations that meet the urgent protection classification dropped from 28 percent in 1998 to 15 percent in 2008. The vast majority (85 percent) of child maltreatment reports, investigations, and open file services in Canada involve &ldquo;non-urgent&rdquo; situations of child neglect, emotional maltreatment, and family violence that threaten the well-being of children (Trocm&eacute;, Kyte, Sinha, and Fallon, 2014).</p>

    <p>Understanding the complex factors associated with the continuing increase of child maltreatment and children&rsquo;s chronic needs requires further study. Some researchers hypothesize that two decades of education about childhood physical and sexual abuse may be helping to reduce the incidence.</p>

    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-161" class="ch-link">Individual versus Structural Orientation</a></p>

    <p>Another source of debate within child-welfare practice and policy involves &ldquo;individual&rdquo; versus &ldquo;structural&rdquo; explanations and solutions. Child-protection legislation tends to take a more individualistic approach, that is, responsibility rests with the parent(s) to provide a safe and supportive environment. Child maltreatment is constructed as an individual parental failing. However, this perspective can obscure broader socio-economic conditions and structural and ecological factors that may be contributing to a child&rsquo;s neglect and abuse.</p>

    <p>Many researchers and practitioners argue for a more comprehensive approach to child welfare, one that addresses the systemic issues, such as poverty and discrimination, that can jeopardize a child&rsquo;s well-being. This perspective acknowledges the relationship between personal struggles and the degree of adequacy of social conditions (or &ldquo;structural imperatives&rdquo;).We know, for example, that social and economic inequality based on gender, race, ability, and length of time in the country are reflected in disproportionately high child poverty rates. Lone mothers and their children are one of the most economically vulnerable groups, with almost one in every two female lone-parent families (47 percent) living in poverty. Low income among new immigrants is more than three times higher than among people born in Canada. Compared to people of European background, racialized people are more likely to be unemployed or in low-paying occupations. Along with a broad national poverty-reduction strategy, policies are needed that address these systemic barriers to equality.</p>

	<p>In 2009, the Qu&eacute;bec Department of Health and Social Services advocated for the development and implementation of province-wide integrated services for families affected by child neglect. The program that emerged was the Ecosystemic and Developmental Intervention Program for Children and Families&mdash;Second Generation (EDIP-CF2).</p>

	<p>This program&rsquo;s theoretical foundation is an ecosystem approach that recognizes that child neglect is characterized by children &ldquo;in need&rdquo; and occurs due to the collapse of the social organization surrounding the children and their parents. Lacharit&eacute; (2014) asserts that rather than viewing child neglect as a consequence of a parent&ndash;child relationship (predominant in residual child welfare), it should be viewed as a breakdown of the family&ndash;community relationship.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, the EDIP-CF2 incorporates a developmental model which understands neglect in terms of the developmental needs of the child, but also considers parenting as a developmental challenge for adults. The goals are to ensure that children are surrounded by adults (including parental figures and family members) who are attentive and responsive to the child&rsquo;s developmental needs with a vision of the capacity, resources, and obstacles in the child&rsquo;s environment.</p>

	<p>Service planning requires an understanding of the social conditions necessary for the adults to fulfill the child&rsquo;s needs; parental and child (if old enough) involvement in the analysis of the situation and the plan of action; parental awareness of their role in the child&rsquo;s development; and a recognition that community systems (daycares, schools, etc.) are involved and must be in step with the plan to ensure positive developmental outcomes. This appears to be a hopeful and innovative practice, which the rest of Canada will be watching with much&#160;interest.</p>

	<p>Child-welfare service procedures are outlined in detail in the various provincial standards manuals. Specific criteria for determining whether a child needs protection are found in provincial child-welfare acts. What follows are the general steps for providing child-welfare services in Canada.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Initial Response to Reports of Abuse and Neglect</p>

	<p>The person receiving a report of child abuse and neglect must exercise careful judgement. Workers should collect accurate information from various sources, such as the child, other family members, and neighbours, and from persons with well-meaning intentions as well as from persons intending to make malicious accusations. Even though decision making may be difficult and emotional, workers must make decisions in the best interests of the child. The response steps are as follows:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">receiving the report</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">obtaining complete information from the informant</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">assessing the motivation and credibility of the informant</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">checking records</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">determining if an investigation is necessary</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">developing an initial investigation plan</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">documenting the reported abuse or neglect</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Investigation</p>

	<p>The social worker should obtain detailed and complete information using interviews, observations, and assessment and service reports from professionals, checking all available records. All decisions must be based on detailed, accurate, and documented evidence. Crucial decisions must be made at this juncture in response to the following questions:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item">Has the child been abused?</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">What are the immediate safety needs of the child?</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">Is there a risk of future harm?</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">What is the capacity of the family to protect the child?</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">What services are required by the child and family?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All provincial child-welfare acts empower child-protection workers to enter premises to remove children whom they deem to be in need of protection. Workers will frequently interview children at school, as this is considered a safe and familiar environment. Interviewing children requires considerable skill and interpersonal sensitivity.</p>

	<p>While each province and, indeed, each local agency has its own policies and procedures, general investigative guidelines are common. A typical investigation would include</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">conducting a telephone interview with the person who reported the alleged abuse and with any other individuals who have pertinent information;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">searching existing agency records for any present or past contact with the family, the alleged abuser, or the child;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">contacting the Child Abuse Register to ascertain if the alleged abuser is registered, and if so, why; contacting any child-welfare authorities that previously registered the alleged abuser;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">seeing the child who is alleged to have been abused and conducting an interview using methods appropriate to the child’s developmental stage and ability to communicate;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">ensuring that the alleged abuser is interviewed by the police or an agency worker pursuant to the protocol established between the agency and the police;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">interviewing the parent or person having charge of the child, if he or she is not the alleged abuser;</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">interviewing other potential victims (e.g., siblings, other children in the home, classmates);</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">gathering evidence from other professionals involved in the investigation (e.g., medical, law enforcement, educational); and</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item">gathering information from other witnesses.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Assessing the urgency of a response is critical. The child who is the subject of a report of abuse must be seen as soon as possible, generally not later than 12 hours after the report is made. To assess urgency, the social worker should consider the child’s age, the nature of the alleged abuse, the known injury to the child, the potential for the child to suffer physical harm, the availability of possible evidence (e.g., visible marks), and the immediate need for counselling or support. The worker should ensure that a medical examination is performed by a qualified medical practitioner when there is a need to document the child’s condition. A medical examination may also be necessary to ascertain whether the child has been harmed. This can be arranged by obtaining the cooperation of a parent. If cooperation cannot be obtained, it may be necessary to apprehend the child and conduct the examination without parental consent.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><a href="#" id="page-163" class="ch-link">Substantiation</a></p>

	<p>Agencies generally have established policies and procedures outlining how a protection substantiation decision occurs. This decision must be made at a formal meeting in consultation with the social worker’s supervisor or higher authorities. The worker should record the process of substantiation and the standards of proof for making the decision in the case file.</p>

	<p>There are generally four possible investigative outcomes:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">The complaint is not substantiated.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">A protection concern is substantiated, but the child remains in the home.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item ">A protection concern is substantiated, and the child remains in the home but may be in need of protection. With this option, a plan must be developed to ensure the child’s safety, including a schedule of visits and restricted access by some family members. This approach is consistent with the philosophy of taking the “least restrictive” course of action to protect the child.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item -Last">A protection concern is substantiated, and the child is removed from the home.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Assessment Report and Service Plan</p>

	<p>If abuse is verified, the law requires a complete assessment and a plan of service for the child and family. The assessment report should address the following: the nature of the abuse, precipitating factors, the nature of the dispute, family dysfunction, family background, parental capacity, family relationships, family strengths, service needs, child development, and the risk of further abuse.</p>

	<p>The service plan should include the specific risk factors, service needs, strategies and service providers, ongoing care responsibility and coordination, expectations, review dates, and client involvement in the service plan.</p>

	<p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Case Management</p>

	<p>Case management is the coordination of services for clients by allocating a professional to be responsible for the assessment of need and implementation of service plans. It involves coordinating the various system components in order to achieve a successful outcome.</p>

	<p>Case management activities include (1) assessment, (2) planning, (3) linking clients and services, (4) monitoring the quality of the services provided, and (5) advocacy. The primary goal is service provision for the client, not management of the system or its resources.</p>

	<p>Careful record keeping is mandatory in child welfare agencies. A case worker must be able to substantiate the decisions made. Supervision, consultation, review, and decision making occur frequently during the management of all child abuse cases. All agencies have strict documentation requirements.</p>

	<p>Agencies must also evaluate the effectiveness of their case management approach and make adjustments as needed. What outcomes are expected for effective service delivery to children and families?</p>

					<p>A central challenge in child protection social work is to achieve a safe balance of parental or kin responsibility while ensuring the child&rsquo;s safety. It is not easy. An innovative, collaborative approach that has emerged in recent years is the Family Group Conference (FGC).</p>
<p>A Family Group Conference involves a formal meeting between family members and social workers (and possibly other interested parties, such as the police or elders) with respect to the care of a child or adolescent. This method appears to have originated in New Zealand, where it was developed to facilitate social work practice that respects the values and culture of the Maori, New Zealand&rsquo;s Indigenous people. In this model of practice, immediate and extended family members, with the support of child and family practitioners, work together to make decisions that best meet the needs of the child.</p>
<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Key Elements of a Family Group Conference</p>
<p>The Family Group Conference process has four main stages: (1) a meeting where professionals inform the family of the concerns they have; (2) private family time, where the family alone develops a plan that addresses the concerns; (3) a meeting where the plan is presented to the professionals; and finally (4) the implementation and review of the plan itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Family&rdquo; in this case includes the children, parents, extended family, and even significant friends and neighbours who may not be blood-related. This group is given &ldquo;private&rdquo; time to develop a plan that will ensure the safe care and protection of a child or children in need. The social work professional is involved at the beginning of the process and in the assessment of the plan following a decision. Professionals are excluded from the private time, which is attended by family members only.</p>
<p>The principles that underpin the Family Group Conference process are as follows:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item">The child&rsquo;s interests are paramount.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">The child should have the resources for his or her voice to be heard.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">The child&rsquo;s views, feelings, and solutions are as valid as those of the participating adults.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Children are generally best looked after within their families. Services should seek to promote this wherever possible.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Working in partnership with families is beneficial for children.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Families have the ability to make rational and sound decisions about their future and the future of the children involved.</li>
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Given the right environment and the correct information, families instinctively know what is best for their children.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Family Group Conference emerged as an alternative and progressive way to work with children and families at risk. The approach can be used in a number of different contexts: child welfare, youth offences, domestic violence, children as young carers, foster care breakdown, adoption, and so on. The successful outcomes where this method has been applied demonstrate that the approach has great potential, as the adjacent case study shows.</p>

		            <div class="grid--full cf">
		                <p class="text--bold">Sally, a child protection social worker with six years&rsquo; experience in a Delegated Child Welfare Aboriginal Agency in British Columbia, is called in to help a family plan ways to support a young mother struggling with grief and addiction.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, Sally received a call from Darla, who is very concerned about her sister, Darlene Luis, a lone parent to Lia, aged 4 and May, aged 2&frac12;. Darlene&rsquo;s boyfriend and father of her children, Mike, committed suicide three months ago. On the previous Saturday night, Darlene called her 17-year-old niece Natalie (Darla&rsquo;s daughter) to babysit Lia and May. Darlene didn&rsquo;t return home until Monday at 5:00 a.m.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Darlene has disappeared for several days. Darla told Sally that Darlene&rsquo;s house is in disarray and there are empty liquor bottles everywhere. There is little food in the house and unwashed laundry lies in piles. The girls watch TV most days while Darlene sleeps or drinks. Sally thanked Darla and agreed to meet Darlene later that day.</p>

<p>When Darlene met with Sally, Darlene admitted that she had been drinking daily since Mike had died and that she wasn&rsquo;t coping well. Respectfully, Sally explained to Darlene that because of her drinking, the lack of food, and the state of the family home, she did not think it was safe for the girls to stay with Darlene. Sally recommended that she make a referral to the Aboriginal Family Group Conference (FGC) Coordinator. Darlene agreed with Sally&rsquo;s assessment and consented to participate in a family conference.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The First Priority: Safeguarding the Children</p>

<p>When Darlene met with Shari, the FGC Coordinator, Shari asked Darlene which family members she wished to attend the meeting with her. Darlene specified Darla, Natalie, and her Auntie Molly, who is an Elder in the community. She also asked that Nicole, the counsellor she had seen after Mike died, attend. Other people included her best friend and neighbour, Roberta and Roberta&rsquo;s husband, George, her dad, and Mike&rsquo;s mom. The family group conference was arranged for the following Wednesday afternoon. On the day of the conference, Shari brought cookies and juice. She arranged the chairs in a circle and greeted everyone when they arrived. She had taped pictures of Lia and May to the wall and on the table she had placed a family photo of Darlene, Mike, Lia, and May. Shari opened the meeting by stating that Lia and May were the primary reason that they had gathered together. Everyone agreed that they needed to collaborate to develop a plan to ensure that the children were safe while Darlene sought help for her drinking problem. Shari asked the group to brainstorm ideas that might spare the children from being placed in foster care. Sally explained that she would take part in the discussions at first and then go outside to give the family some private time. Shari stayed to help the family and to take notes. Darlene cried when she saw the family photos. Roberta held her hand and told her they were all there to support her. Molly suggested they pray to the Creator for guidance and led the group through a smudge.</p>

<p>Sally waited outside while Shari helped the family write out a plan on a flip chart. An hour later, Shari joined Sally at the picnic table outside to give the family and friends some privacy to complete the plan.</p>

<p>When Sally and Shari were invited back, the family explained the plan. Darlene would go to an alcohol treatment centre, and Lia and May would stay with Darla and Natalie until she returned home. Molly agreed to help with household tasks when Darlene returned to the community. Darlene&rsquo;s dad offered to take her to a sweat lodge when she returned from treatment. Roberta and George promised to maintain the house and yard while Darlene was in treatment. George also said that he would work with the band council to make sure that Darlene&rsquo;s freezer was stocked with food for the winter. Mike&rsquo;s mom offered to drop by when she came to town on Saturdays to look after the girls for a few hours. Darlene asked Sally if the agency could cover daycare costs three days a week so she could get alcohol and drug counselling and attend a bereavement support group.</p>

<p>Sally suggested that the family try the plan for two months and then reconvene to review it and modify it if necessary. Shari typed up the plan for everyone to sign. Darlene thanked everyone and expressed relief that her girls could stay with family rather than go into foster care. She entered a treatment centre the following Tuesday.</p>

					<p>At times, risks to a child&rsquo;s safety become so significant that either short-term or long-term substitute care is required. Taking children into care is usually a last resort, occurring only after deliberation with the social-work child protection team and their supervisors.</p>
<p>Although kinship care is the preferred form of substitute care, non-kin foster families are very common. Despite the stereotype that foster parents are &ldquo;in it for the money&rdquo; and sensationalized stories of foster parents abusing children, the majority of these parents provide an invaluable resource for children requiring alternative, family-based care. Across Canada, governments are paying heed to the recruitment and retention of foster parents, particularly those of Indigenous ancestry.</p>
<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Meeting the Needs of Foster Children</p>
<p>Foster parents face daunting challenges: foster children have complex needs requiring special attention and skills. The foster-care system itself needs upgrading, too. As Peter Dudding, executive director with the Child Welfare League of Canada (CWLC) points out, &ldquo;there are problems in the current system with overcrowding, placement mismatches, and lack of training and support, all of which can result in placement breakdown and harm for these children&rdquo; (CWLC press release, March 30, 2010). Foster parents may end their relationship with a child for multiple reasons, but lack of support from placement agencies is a primary complaint.</p>
<p>Foster parents need support around &ldquo;breakdowns or disruptions [of placements], allegations, relations with birth parents, family tensions, &lsquo;tug of love&rsquo; cases, and other disagreements with social services&rdquo; (Wilson et al., 2000: 193). Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, most foster parents step forward because they care about vulnerable children and want to make a difference. In Selishia&rsquo;s Story, Selishia&rsquo;s foster parents provide a safer environment for her than her birth parents could. However, Selishia feels that the money associated with her care differentiates her from her foster parents&rsquo; birth children. Her foster family provides a stable environment, but when some normal teenage rebellious milestones occur, the consequent challenges and conflicts lead to a traumatic replacement for Selishia.</p>
<p>Social workers can help provide stability and continuity for a child in substitute care by facilitating a good relationship between the child and the foster parents, supplying information about normal developmental milestones, providing parenting support, and promoting conflict resolution to repair normal, everyday tensions that occur in all families.</p>
<p>Like many children in her situation, Selishia had no warning that her life would change drastically. While social workers may have visited the foster family, Selishia has no memory of such visits. She now knows that a decision was made for her safety, but she was either not told the reasons for the decision, or they were not explained so that a five-year-old could understand. If we consider Selishia&rsquo;s story in the context of Maslow&rsquo;s &ldquo;hierarchy of needs,&rdquo; we see that her physiological and safety needs were met and that some of her love and belonging needs were met, but not all. This made her feel excluded and different. Her self-esteem improved after connecting with the M&eacute;tis community and meeting other youth in care.</p>

		            <div class="grid--full cf">
		                <p class="text--bold">This is a true account of one individual&rsquo;s experience of being removed from her biological family and placed in substitute care. Selishia was interviewed by the author and has consented to share her experiences publicly. Selishia&rsquo;s real name has been used because she believes that telling her story authentically is part of her process of personal healing.</p>

<p>Selishia&rsquo;s early years were spent with her mom, dad, and older sister. One day, when she was five years old, there was a knock at the door. With no warning, a woman she had never seen before removed Selishia and her nine-year-old sister from their home and took them to live with a foster family. Selishia remembers that day clearly, and recalls that she had absolutely no idea what was happening or why. She also vividly recalls crying every night for eight months.</p>

<p>Selishia and her sister lived with the same foster family until she was 16 years old. She received good marks in school, played soccer, stayed away from drugs, and found full-time employment. Despite these signs of stability, however, she came home from school one day, and a social worker&mdash;again, someone she had never met&mdash;told her that she was going to be moved elsewhere. Having been labelled a &ldquo;rebellious&rdquo; teen, she was placed in a rural foster home for youth with extreme behavioural problems. Selishia recalls falling into a major depression at this time. However, she told no one about her depressed emotional state.</p>

<p>During the 11 years that Selishia spent in her first foster home, the foster mother worked outside the home and the foster father was on a disability pension. Selishia and her sister were permanent foster children, and two other children eventually became permanent. Three or four short-term foster children also came to stay at intervals, and the family had two biological children. Thus, throughout most of Selishia&rsquo;s stay, there were seven to nine children in the home.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Selishia&rsquo;s Family History</p>

<p>The foster family had forbidden Selishia to speak openly about being a foster child. Nevertheless, if the family was out in the community, they would introduce Selishia as a foster child. When the family went to Mexico for a holiday when Selishia was 12, she and the other foster children were left at home. Selishia&rsquo;s physical care was good, and there was a sense of permanency. However, when she was removed from this foster family at the age of 16, there was no prior discussion at all. During her 11-year stay in this home, she had had only rare contact with her biological parents and had only pieced together her family of origin&rsquo;s history by overhearing conversations. When she reached adolescence and learned of her mother&rsquo;s drug addiction, her father&rsquo;s criminal history, and the poverty in which her biological family had been living, Selishia&rsquo;s developing sense of self was eroded.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Struggling to Achieve a Sense of Connectedness</p>

<p>A M&eacute;tis woman, Selishia was unaware of her cultural identity until the age of nine or ten. When she did learn of her cultural background, she asked to be included in local M&eacute;tis community activities. Developing a healthy sense of self and belonging was a struggle for Selishia. At school, for example, any lessons associated with &ldquo;family&rdquo; were painful exercises in fabrication for her. Unable to acknowledge that she was a foster child and having little knowledge of her own family meant concocting a series of lies that piled up over time.</p>

<p>Selishia yearned to &ldquo;fit in,&rdquo; but she felt isolated and alienated. While in foster care, she had contact with approximately 14 social workers, but never developed a relationship with any of them (even though they were, in all likelihood, her appointed guardians). She didn&rsquo;t even understand what a social worker did. She knew only that her foster family was required to contact them in order to grant her permission for a school field trip, to have a sleepover with her best friend, or to get a navel piercing.</p>

<p>Selishia sometimes missed out on field trips and sleepovers because her social workers did not return phone calls in time. The navel piercing was vetoed by a social worker whom Selishia had met only once, who recommended that she get a nose ring instead. Another social worker whom she had met only once told Selishia that she must have poor hygiene because she had acne. Selishia cannot remember the names of most of the social workers who were involved in making the major decisions that affected her life over a significant period of&#8239;time.</p>

					<p>Every year, as many as 6,000 youth in Canada &ldquo;age out&rdquo; of, or leave, government care and must move out on their own because they have reached the legal age of majority (Mann-Feder, 2011). These youth are expected to live independently at an earlier age than other Canadians, despite their often-compromised development as a result of being victims of abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Leaving home for any young person is fraught with difficulty, but leaving care for these young people often means leaving the only safe place they have ever known.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Best Practices in Discharge Planning</p>

<p>Youth &ldquo;aging out of care&rdquo; do not fare as well as other youth. Studies indicate that they are more likely to be undereducated and under- or unemployed; live below the poverty line; and experience incarceration, homelessness, and dependency on social assistance. They are also at higher risk for early parenthood, substance abuse, and mental health issues (Mann-Feder,&nbsp;2007).</p>
<p>Canadian youth aging out of care have cited the following requirements as being crucial to ensure a better transition to adulthood: ongoing supportive relationships; peer support and independent living training; increased access to financial support; and support in gaining access to education, employment, and training programs.</p>
<p>In several studies, youth who have aged out of child welfare have spoken of their experiences and highlighted areas where they could have been better prepared for their transition from care. Best practices suggest that strong youth participation in discharge planning is an important factor in developing resilience and continuing aftercare (Tweddle, 2005). A current example in Qu&eacute;bec, <em>le Projet de Qualifications des Jeunes</em>, stresses the importance of a stable, long-term relationship with one adult for the highest-risk youth who are exiting care. In this program, each young person is assigned a youth worker prior to discharge, and this relationship continues for a year after discharge (Mann-Feder, 2007).</p>
<p>Nineteen U.S. states have extended foster care support to age 21. Ontario recently adopted the same policy, and its youth advocate has penned a cost-benefit study arguing that it would be economical for the province to boost the age of support even higher, to 25. &ldquo;If (foster care) and other supports are extended for four additional years, fewer youth will likely become involved with the criminal justice system. Fewer youth will likely access social assistance. More youth will likely finish high school and post-secondary education, thereby increasing their earnings and the taxes they will pay.&rdquo; (Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, 2012).</p>
<p>More must to be done to address the needs of this small but significant&mdash;and very vulnerable&mdash;population. The next story (Selishia&rsquo;s Story, Part Two), a continuation of the previous story, shows youth participation and resilience at their best. Selishia not only transitions successfully out of care, seemingly with minimal support, but moves on to study to become a social work practitioner herself. Her insider advice to practitioners dealing with youth aging out of care, based on personal experience and deep reflection, is all the more relevant for that reason.</p>

		            <div class="grid--full cf">
		                <p class="text--bold">“Leaving home” can be daunting for young people who have grown up in foster care. Here, Selishia narrates her journey out of care and suggests ways in which social workers can support youth undergoing this transition.</p>

		                <p>After spending six months with a new foster family and participating in a family mediation meeting, Selishia returned to her original foster home. However, this reunification quickly broke down, and Selishia went to live with an aunt and uncle in another community during her Grade 11 school year.</p>

		                <p>She does not recall exactly when and how she became a continuing custody order (CCO) child in care. However, at the age of 17 while she was in Grade 12, she signed a youth agreement and began to live independently in a basement suite. She worked full time while also attending classes full time. She graduated from high school, and at the age of 19 signed an agreement that provided her with a living allowance if she pursued studies at a college or university. She was also promised a partial grant for academic fees if she continued her studies.</p>

		                <p>Finding One’s Own Voice and Identity</p>

		                <p>A pivotal event in Selishia’s life has been her involvement with “Voices of Experience,” an after-school educational program that features accomplished women role models from diverse backgrounds speaking about their lives, education, and careers. For most of her life, Selishia felt alone and different from her peers because of her status as a foster child and then as a continuing custody order child. After joining the Voices of Experience, she was able to see her experiences in a larger context and no longer felt that she needed to hide her identity, but rather could acknowledge it openly. For Selishia, telling her story at this stage of her life is “not about receiving pity or getting attention, but about sharing knowledge and being able to have others relate to her [experiences and challenges].”</p>

		                <p>Currently, Selishia is a 21-year-old university student with an A average who wants to be a social worker. She also trains to enter body sculpting competitions. Despite being separated from her family of origin and feeling lonely and alienated for many years, she has developed resilience and self-sufficiency and describes herself as a “survivor” of government care.</p>

		                <p>When she finds herself struggling with adult transitions and decisions, Selishia contacts her sister. She does not have a home where she can spend Christmas, or someone to ask about how to make medical appointments, or relatives with whom she can swap family recipes. She has no safety net other than the one she has determinedly woven—and continues to weave—for herself.</p>

		                <p>Selishia identifies four areas that social workers should focus on when intervening with children and youth in care:</p>

		                <p><span class="text--bold">Explain the child’s rights. </span>Selishia was labelled as a rebellious teenager when she started to learn more about her rights and to question authority. For example, she learned that her foster parents had been receiving money to clothe her, despite the fact that she had been working since the age of 12 to earn money to buy clothes.</p>

		                <p><span class="text--bold">Recognize that “acting out” and “manipulation” signal that young people are searching for their own voice. </span>Children and youth in care rarely have role models to teach them how to advocate for themselves appropriately, and they must learn to fend for themselves early in life compared to most children. Acting out and yelling are often protective devices against further emotional pain—and sometimes the only way that young people know how to get their voices or opinions heard.</p>

		                <p><span class="text--bold">Assign consistent social workers who are willing to forge a positive and understanding relationship. </span>There was no social worker in Selishia’s life to whom she could relate until she was 16; she remains in contact with this individual. However, prior to this, social workers whom Selishia did not even know could exert control over her friendships and her activities.</p>

		                <p><span class="text--bold">Acknowledge the insidious and ever-present experience of trauma and neglect. </span>Being removed from a parental home and/or having multiple placements is traumatizing. Extensive emotional damage occurs when a child or youth lacks nurturing and safety. Not knowing in advance that a move is about to occur, or why a move has been arranged, compounds the trauma unnecessarily. All children should be provided with age-appropriate information about their own situation.</p>

						<p class="text--bold">As Marian describes below, social work practice in the area of child protection presents many unique challenges and frustrations&mdash;as well as rewards. It is demanding but important work that benefits society in countless ways.</p>

						<p>Although child protection is one of the most complex and challenging areas of social work, many social workers begin their careers in child welfare. At the age of 25, I was hired by British Columbia&rsquo;s Ministry of Children and Families as an auxiliary child welfare worker with a generalist caseload.</p>

						<p>I had graduated in social work post-Gove, so my focus was on child-centredness and prioritizing children&rsquo;s needs. I was completely unprepared, however, for the many cases that involved extreme violence, murder, and suicide that are now seared into my memory. I also didn&rsquo;t anticipate the bureaucratic hurdles. At times, it seemed like there were more people ensuring my paperwork was complete than front-line social workers helping families.</p>

						<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Balancing Personal Life and Professional Life</p>

						<p>Despite the horrors I encountered, I have fond memories of assisting many families. I am especially proud of my focus on &ldquo;concurrent planning,&rdquo; which entailed working on permanency planning while completing an investigation.</p>

						<p>For example, one of my cases involved a 12-year-old boy whose mother had passed away when he was two. He lived with his father and step-siblings and was sexually abused by his father, who was eventually convicted and jailed. In the course of the investigation, I was able to access information that helped reconnect the boy with his previously estranged maternal family. They created a scrapbook for him and provided information about his mom and her family members.</p>

						<p>During the 13 years that I worked for the Ministry of Children and Families, I experienced personal and professional growth. Professionally, it took me two to three years to understand the job fully. Eventually, though, changes in my personal life affected my ability to work in the area of child protection. I got married and thought about having children. However, I was so used to seeing maltreated and traumatized children and their resulting special needs that I worried about having children of my own. Over time, as my friends and family started having babies, my concerns were balanced by seeing the joy of raising healthy children. I had a beautiful son and returned to work after my maternity leave.</p>

						<p>But I had changed. In particular, I found that my objectivity had eroded and it was much more difficult not to personalize situations. Within a couple of months of my return to work, I went out on a case in which a mother was struggling with mental health issues and had attempted suicide. Her nine-month-old baby was removed for safety reasons. The baby, similar in age to my own son, coincidentally had the same name. This case completely overwhelmed me and was a turning point in my career. Within 18 months I had transferred into work in child and youth mental health.</p>

						<p>Burnout and compassion fatigue are realities for many social workers in child protection. Yet, despite the rigours of learning the job and the rigidity of the bureaucracy, I have absorbed valuable lessons into my ongoing social work. I remain committed to collaborative community work in child welfare, support changes that enable working together with Aboriginal children, families, and communities, and continue to advocate for children. I am a better parent as a result of my experiences in child welfare. This type of work is difficult for new social work grads, but it is vital work that really matters.</p>

						<p>For the child protection system to continue to improve, we need new eyes, fresh thinking, and strong beliefs to offset entrenched, bureaucratic processes. I don&rsquo;t at all regret my practice in child protection, as it continues to be a strong foundation for my evolving career in social work.</p>

		      <ul class="ul--list">
		  	    
		  	      <li>According to Gaetz, Donaldson, Richter, and Gulliver’s The State of Homelessness in Canada 2013, youth account for approximately 20&#160;percent of the homeless population in Canada (i.e., 6,000 young people on any given night). Consider why some young people might choose a life on the streets. What societal conditions make this choice more likely? What can social workers do both at the practice level and the policy level to help prevent this?</li>
		  	    
		  	      <li>Research how child-welfare legislation in your province or territory has changed over the past several years. What positive policies have been implemented? What laws might restrict a social worker’s ability to apply best practices? What areas are still in need of improvement?</li>
		  	    
		  	      <li>Suggest some possible self-care strategies by which child welfare workers might reduce burnout nd compassion fatigue as a result of work-related pressures and sometimes overwhelming caseloads. What might indicate whether these strategies are successful in mitigating signs and symptoms of burnout and fatigue?</li>
