To be effective, social work interventions must be evidence-based according to the latest research and thinking in the field, but the effectiveness of social work interventions is also rooted in the social worker’s judgement and creativity, and on a fundamental trust between the individual practitioner and the client or clients. Some might even argue that it is the strength of the worker–client relationship that is the most important factor in fostering positive outcomes. Most schools of social work distinguish between three categories of direct social work practice: (1) individuals and families, (2) group work, and (3) community work. Most social workers and social service workers will find themselves practising in one or more of these areas, and may be involved in all three over the course of their careers. As “change-makers,” social workers must acquire multiple skills and a broad-based perspective. This chapter introduces the main skills that a social worker is likely to need in each of the three areas of direct practice.</p>

Each community appoints a facilitator who takes the lead in dt eveloping the CTC board and strategy. The board chooses from a list of evidence-based programs to suit that community&rsquo;s particular needs and implements those programs using existing community resources.</p>

                    <p>Social work practice consists of a series or a process of interventionist actions. Workers call upon their repertoire of knowledge, skills, and values and apply it in particular ways in specific situations to help clients achieve purposeful change. While each situation will require different interventions, the step-by-step process is essentially the same.</p>
                    <p>A useful analogy is that of a skilled dancer who knows the steps involved in a particular dance, but to be truly excellent, must recombine the movements into new patterns. To respond to the unique needs of the client&mdash;whether individual, family, group, or community&mdash;competent social work practice requires this kind of artful improvising, or the ability to &ldquo;think on one&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo; in combination with the knowledge and value base associated with the profession.</p>
                    <p>Social work practice is fundamentally related to decision making along a continuum of services from first encounter to the conclusion of the working relationship with a client. Decisions might pertain to questions such as the following: Is this person eligible for services? Which services might be a good match to the client&rsquo;s needs? Which theory best applies to the unique needs of this individual or family? Which interventions would be most appropriate? Is individual work or group work best suited to this situation? Are there circumstances that should be reported to a legislated authority? How will the worker know when to end the working relationship?</p>
                    <p>Decisions in social work are often made in the midst of complex and uncertain conditions with information that may not be reliable or consistent. However, to provide fair and impartial services, the decision-making process must be transparent, purposeful, and free of bias. Simply adopting a &ldquo;go with your gut&rdquo; or intuitive approach to helping others is not sufficient. On the other hand, relying solely on empirical research to validate decision making and subsequent actions may also be difficult given the varied and unique circumstances of each situation. What is indisputable is the centrality of the helping relationship to positive outcomes. Studies have found that the helping relationship may account for as much as 30 percent of positive outcomes, regardless of the different therapies or interventions used (Norcross, 2002).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Vital Importance of Evidence-Based Practice in Social Work</p>
                    <p>Social workers strive to draw upon the best available knowledge and research to guide their direct and indirect practice. The concept of <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-1">evidence-based practice (EBP)</span> is central to effective social work practice. Based on the work of Sackett, Richardson, Rosenburg, and Haynes, evidence-based decision making has been defined as &ldquo;the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient [client] values&rdquo; (cited in Glasner-Edwards and Rawson, 2010). In this model, research evidence alone is not sufficient to determine a particular intervention. Similarly, worker experience and judgement alone are not sufficient; nor can the client&rsquo;s wishes serve as the sole decision-making factor. Evidence-based decision making depends on the integration of factors such as scientific knowledge, the social worker&rsquo;s experience and judgement, and the client&rsquo;s preferences, values, and circumstances. Evidence-based practice helps clinicians to collect and critically appraise the best evidence (from literature, self, and client) in order to guide an intervention or treatment decision.</p>
                    <p>Gitterman and Knight (2013) employ the term &ldquo;evidence-guided practice,&rdquo; as it integrates the science and the art of social work. Evidence-guided practice, from this perspective, incorporates research findings, theoretical constructs, and a repertoire of the profession&rsquo;s values and ethics. It also takes into account the individual social worker&rsquo;s distinctive style.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the approach taken to social work, it is important to have a basic understanding of all three areas (or fields) of direct practice, shown in Figure 4.1.</p>
                    <p>Working with vulnerable individuals and families draws many practitioners to social work. However, it has long been recognized that the blend of support and empowerment that occurs in a group in which people with similar life situations share stories and hear about one another&rsquo;s experiences can be equally or even more powerful than individual support. Generalist social work, rooted In the &ldquo;person in environment&rdquo; or ecological approach, recognizes the interdependency between individuals and their communities (whether geographic or identity-related), and, therefore, direct practice also involves a third area: building on community strengths to enhance the social determinants of health and well-being.</p>
                    <p>As Figure 4.1 indicates, each field influences the other fields and reveals that a primary intervention in one field may involve some level of intervention in another. For example, working in the area of substance use may entail working with the family; accessing AA and Al-Anon groups; and working with schools or communities to promote skills for healthy living. Another example of overlapping fields of practice is the Garden Gate project in Kamloops, B.C. This project provides rehabilitation, skills training, and vocational training for persons with mental health disabilities on a horticultural site that includes a greenhouse, a vegetable garden, and a kitchen/classroom. Participants and volunteers increase their own food security by taking home organic produce in exchange for their help in the garden, while at the same time increasing the community&rsquo;s food security by producing fruits and vegetables for local food charities.</p>

                    <p>The process of helping individuals is sometimes called <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-2">casework</span>. A majority of social workers spend their time with individuals in private or public agencies or in private practice, although the latter is still comparatively less common. Although other areas of social work are expanding, the practice of social work with individuals still predominates.</p>
                    <p>Social work with individuals is primarily aimed at helping people resolve their problems or change their situations on a one-to-one basis&mdash;for example, helping unemployed people obtain work or job training, providing protective services for children who are being abused, counselling people dealing with mental health issues, providing parole or probation services, supplying services to homeless and impoverished individuals, coordinating services for people with AIDS, or coordinating discharge services for individuals being released from hospital.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Helping Relationship Is Central to Work with Individuals and Families</p>
                    <p>A social worker works collaboratively with the client, not for the client, in a <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-3">helping relationship.</span> In this relationship, the client will likely confide personal information to the social worker. The practitioner listens attentively and becomes involved in a manner that benefits the client.</p>
                    <p>The helping relationship involves certain key elements: deep listening, an emotional bond between client and worker, and eventual agreement on treatment goals and tasks. Psychologist Carl Rogers emphasized three important attributes in the client&ndash;practitioner relationship:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Warmth.</span> Social workers rarely believe that they should keep clients at a distance. Too much emphasis on diagnostic labels and professional objectivity can interfere with developing a warm relationship. Warmth is especially important during the early stages of intervention as trust and acceptance develop. Warmth communicates to clients that the worker is approachable and genuinely cares about them. Warmth might involve simple courtesies such as offering a comfortable seat or making appropriate eye contact. It means taking time to show a caring attitude about the client&rsquo;s needs, despite busy or overbooked schedules.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Empathy.</span> Empathy is the capacity to relate to another person&rsquo;s subjective experience and frame of reference by means of listening focused on deep understanding. Such understanding can generate powerful bonds of trust and rapport. Often, this understanding begins with acceptance of the client as a person and the suspension of judgement. A non-judgemental stance requires an intention on the part of the social worker to be aware of their own emotions, assumptions, and reactions. It can take time to hone this kind of open and accepting attitude. It is important not to become trapped in the suffering of the client, but at the same time a social worker must be able to perceive and acknowledge the client&rsquo;s pain.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Genuineness.</span> To be genuine is to behave in a real and authentic way. Central to this characteristic is the awareness of one&rsquo;s own feelings, attitudes, and physical responses. In action, genuineness means that a social worker is trustworthy and honest with clients. The goals are to be truthful and timely in all communication with clients and, above all, to do no harm.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The helping relationship is also central to social work with families, which might involve working with a couple, a child and a parent, or entire families to help them address specific situations or achieve purposeful change. Often, the work focuses on communication or relationship difficulties, or on stressful life transitions. It can also focus on family crises, such as violence within the family, relationship breakdown, care for older family members or those with disabilities, issues at school, help for immigrant families, and/or economic instability.</p>

                    <p>Beginning students may be somewhat confused by the different ways in which various textbooks introduce social work practice with individuals and families. Some outline a series of steps, others emphasize a set of skills, and still others stress theories or models of practice. This textbook does not focus on any one of these aspects, but rather introduces all of them&mdash;stressing the helping relationship as a core element.</p>
                    <p>The profession of social work has a long history of addressing the needs of individuals and families, predating that of many other professions. Social work models tend to emphasize empowering individuals and developing more secure relationships between family members. When working with vulnerable families, such as families in transition (e.g., immigrant families or divorcing parents) and families living in poverty, the emphasis is on stabilizing connections with social institutions, such as schools, churches, child welfare agencies, and hospitals.</p>
                    <p>Social work practice is grounded in theories and evidence-based practices that inform the steps or skills that social workers employ with clients. These steps are common to most social work interventions with individuals and families. Although assessment precedes intervention, and intervention precedes evaluation and termination, the overall process is often cyclical. For example, during intervention, the client and worker may discover new information that raises the need for more planning. In fact, each step can take place at any point in the process. The steps are guideposts that involve combining and recombining actions into new ways of looking at things&mdash;in other words, <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-4">reflection-action-reflection</span> occurs. Stepping back to look, listen, and reflect are closely linked to improvements in practice.</p>

                    <p>Social work practice with individuals and families involves a set of skills that can be continually improved. Often, social work students will engage in role-playing exercises, which afford an effective way to practise these skill sets. The skill set for direct intervention should include the following techniques:</p>
                    

                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Active listening.</span> Also known as &ldquo;deep listening,&rdquo; this skill may be the most important one, since it underlies many of the other skills. Without genuinely and actively listening, the social worker cannot fully appreciate the messages, feelings, and needs of the client.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Validating feelings.</span> A social worker validates a client&rsquo;s feelings by conveying an understanding of these feelings. This validation builds rapport and helps the client to identify and sort out a variety of emotions. The social worker must also consider non-verbal emotional responses in developing this understanding.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Interviewing or dialoguing.</span> Open-ended and closed-ended questions are often used to elicit and elaborate on information. Open-ended questions allow the client to explain in greater depth certain aspects of a problem that they see as important. These questions often begin with &ldquo;how&rdquo; or &ldquo;what.&rdquo; Closed-ended questions are often used to check for accuracy.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Paraphrasing.</span> Social workers use paraphrasing to confirm that the meaning the worker has attached to a client&rsquo;s message is the meaning intended by the client. This skill also provides feedback to the client. Beginning social workers need to be aware that overuse of paraphrasing can give the client the impression of being mimicked.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Clarifying.</span> This skill is used to determine if the worker and client are on the same &ldquo;wavelength.&rdquo; It is often used to probe an issue that is not clearly understood by the social worker. It involves asking for specific details about an event, experience, or state of mind. Clarification often becomes a reciprocal process between the social worker and the client, as each tries to understand the essential meaning of what the other is saying.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Summarizing.</span> This skill is used when attempting to capture or pull together the most important aspects of a problem or situation. It provides focus for the next interview and can assist in planning. Both the feelings and content of the client&rsquo;s message should be reflected in a summary statement. Summarizing can also signal that it is time to move on to another topic.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Giving information.</span> Without overwhelming people with too many details at one time, the social worker often shares information about resources in the community (e.g., women&rsquo;s shelters) or information showing that the client is not alone in experiencing the problem. The social worker takes care to ensure that the client realizes they can choose not to act on the information, and provides pamphlets, brochures, or websites when possible.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Interpreting.</span> This skill enables the social worker to delve into the presented problem and &ldquo;read between the lines.&rdquo; By using this skill, you may be able to &ldquo;reframe&rdquo; the issue, giving it your own unique angle. The worker&rsquo;s insights may help the client develop a deeper understanding of what is really going on, and not just what appears to be happening. Always check the client&rsquo;s verbal and non-verbal responses to your interpretations.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Building consensus.</span> Consensus building attempts to work out an agreement as to what should be done to address a problem. Consensus may be easily attained, or there may be discrepancies between what a client says they want and their behaviour, or between separate messages communicated by a client. Confrontation may be used to challenge a client to examine discrepancies. Such confrontation should be non-adversarial, respectful, and used only when a safe and trusting relationship exists between the worker and the client.</li>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-113" class="ch-link">The Role of Critical Self-Reflection</a></p>
                    <p>Social work scholars, such as Bob Mullaly (2002), also emphasize the importance of what is sometimes called <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-5">&ldquo;critical self-reflection&rdquo;</span> or &ldquo;knowledge about oneself.&rdquo; This self-reflection helps social workers understand how their own identities and beliefs, as well as their professional and personal lives, are shaped by forces in society such as parental influences, cultural influences, the media, educational institutions, political movements, and social structures.</p>
                    <p>Critical self-reflection is an ongoing process in the lives and careers of social workers. Self-reflection can pave the way to early identification of latent or overt emotional issues experienced by a social worker that might need exploration and attention. For example, identifying the sensation of being overwhelmed by clients who are struggling with a particular type of dilemma can prompt a social worker to acquire new skills related to that issue and to focus on improved self-care. Examples of such professional and personal growth might include participating in further training in how to deal with clients struggling with a substance use disorder.</p>
                    <p>Social workers can often struggle with deciding whether it is appropriate to share personal feelings or stories with clients. It is important to understand the triggers and underlying motivations that might lead a social worker to self-disclose. There are definitely times when beginning social workers should exercise caution in spontaneously expressing personal feelings. On the other hand, such sharing can help demonstrate that certain feelings are common and emphasize our shared humanity. In adopting a feminist approach, for example, social workers often share personal experiences with clients in order to establish a sense of solidarity and to draw a link to social structures that act as barriers to self-realization.</p>

                                        <p>The direct social work process outlined below consists of four broad stages: (1) intake, (2) assessment and planning, (3)&#160;intervention, and (4) evaluation and termination.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Intake Stage</p>
                                        <p>From the first encounter with the person seeking help to the last, the social worker is mindful of the vital importance of the working relationship. Some identify this relationship as a “therapeutic alliance.” A therapeutic alliance exists when both the social worker and the client feel that theirs is a positive working partnership.</p>
                                        <p>Intake is a process whereby a request for service is put forth either by or for a person, and a social worker responsible for intake then determines whether and what kind of service is to be provided. The social worker attempts to gather initial information to determine what assistance is needed and whether the agency and worker are the appropriate providers. If it is mutually determined that the agency can be of service, then some sort of agreement or contract is drawn up. If it is determined that the client’s needs cannot be met by the agency, then a referral to a different service or agency is made or a decision is made to pursue another route to help.</p>
                                        <p>During the intake phase, the client makes a personal request for help, or someone from the community directs the client to a particular social work agency. The social work relationship can be either voluntary or involuntary. The intake step is voluntary when a client willingly seeks help from a social work agency. For example, a lone parent struggling to care for a child may approach a child welfare agency for assistance. In contrast, an involuntary client is ordered to see a social worker or is required to do so by law. For example, a social worker is required by law to assist a child in danger when the child’s situation has been reported as unsafe by a physician, hospital worker, police officer, or schoolteacher. In such cases, families are often uncooperative, especially if allegations of child abuse have been reported. Working with involuntary clients can often place more demands on a social worker due to resistance and lower motivation on the part of the client(s).</p>
                                        <p>In the intake stage, the social worker acknowledges the client’s need for help, collects information from the client, assesses the client’s problem or situation and, based on the agency’s resources, determines if the social work agency can help the client. In essence, when they first meet, both the worker and the client want answers to specific questions. The applicant or potential client wants to know: Can I get the help I need here? Can this person help me? The worker will ask: Can I help this person, or would it be more appropriate for someone else in this or another agency to offer help?</p>
                                        <p>It is important in this phase for the social worker to clarify his or her role and purpose, as well as the agency’s role. The context of practice is particularly important during the intake phase. In some cases, an agency-mandated intake form or checklist is used. The social worker should ensure that there is some congruence between the mandate of the agency and the issues that are important to the client. In the case of an involuntary client, this congruence is assumed. Finding this similarity forms a kind of contract between client and agency, with the worker as the intermediary. The worker’s function in this initial phase is a form of mediating an engagement between client and agency—a finding of common ground.</p>
                                        <p>The social worker might start the intake process with an opening statement such as the following:</p>
                                        <p>“My name is Lorraine, and I am a social worker here at the social work department. Your doctor has asked me to see you regarding your recovery from your operation and challenges you might be having. This can be a difficult time and, if you wish, I would like to offer some assistance.”</p>
                                        <p>This straightforward statement sets the groundwork and then leaves it open to the client to clarify what the role of the worker might be from his or her perspective.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Assessment and Planning Stage</p>
                                        <p>During assessment, the social worker and the client analyze what help is needed based on the client’s ideas, thoughts, and feelings. Once the assessment is complete, the social worker formulates a plan in collaboration with the client. The plan is not set in stone but provides an initial course of action, which is reviewed and updated throughout the process. The client is viewed as a partner rather than simply a consulted party.</p>
                                        <p>Many textbooks describe a process that involves problem definition, data collection, and “objective” recommendations.In this section, we are emphasizing a social work process that stresses reflection-action-reflection, in which the social worker continually thinks things through while acting on the problem at hand and always in consultation with the client. She or he adapts the intervention based on dialogue, reflection on prior experience, and judgements about past actions.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-115" class="ch-link">During the assessment stage, the social worker may also rely</a> on other people who know the client personally, for example, a teacher, doctor, police officer, or Elder. Assessment involves the art of asking questions. Purposeful and well-timed questions are the cornerstone of this phase. Social workers may prefer a structured interview in which they pose a predetermined set of questions. This is usually the case in agencies that require specific forms to be completed as part of the assessment. In other cases, unstructured interviews are the norm. This type of interviewing is still focused, but takes a more conversational tone and is relatively flexible. With the latter approach, beginning social workers must ensure that the interview does not wander too far off topic.</p>
                                        <p>The planned actions may occur at a variety of levels: individual, environmental, multi-person, systemic, or structural. For example, actions might involve therapeutic, educational, and social action-oriented approaches. What varies between practice models is the focus of attention. A behavioural therapy approach would tend to focus on changing individual behaviours, whereas a social action or structural approach may focus on examining behaviours within a wider context, perhaps exploring how they might be changed, and working toward changing systems in order to shift power relations. There can also be a combination of these approaches. In any event, the social worker assesses the client’s problem with the client and negotiates a plan with the client that includes</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the type of actions or interventions deemed viable,</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the length of the intervention,</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the frequency of meetings and the desired outcomes, and</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the intervention plan (a contract is made with the client).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The concept of empowerment is crucial in the planning phase. The foundation of empowerment is the notion that clients have the right to self-determination and are capable of discerning the best course of action for themselves. Often, clients come in with a negative self-image and a feeling of powerlessness. Sexism or racism may feed into this. This poses a challenge in substituting an attitude of empowerment.</p>
                                        <p>One response is to use a mindfulness approach to explore clients’ thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations. Clients are encouraged to see self-deprecating thoughts as just thoughts and not who they are. They are able to learn that they possess an effective intuitive sense and an inner resilience that can be called upon to face and surmount life’s difficulties.</p>
                                        <p>Other approaches might use consciousness-raising to promote empowerment. Consciousness-raising encourages people to gain insight into their circumstances with a view to changing them. This notion is often associated with progressive, feminist, or structural approaches to social work, but it is increasingly becoming part of many other approaches.</p>
                                        <p>Consciousness-raising can involve one or more activities, including the provision of information concerning the social structures implicated in the person’s situation, reflection based on the client’s lived experiences, sharing of experiences in common with the worker (if this is appropriate), or conscious-awareness exercises that cultivate insight.</p>
                                        <p><a href="#" id="page-116" class="ch-link">Part of the consciousness-raising process involves normalization.</a> Normalization highlights the notion that any particular difficulty that a person experiences is universal and not unique to any one person—that many difficulties are a normal part of being human or being part of a particular social group that is being oppressed or marginalized.</p>

                                        <p>The worker, the client, or both may initiate the intervention stage. The actions may be directed toward the client, other individuals, family members, groups, communities, institutions, social policies, or political and social structures. Intervention does not always focus on the treatment of the individual alone. For example, in situations where the social worker is using a structural or feminist approach to practice, the intervention will usually include some kind of organizational, community, or social action measures in addition to working with a client.</p>
                                        <p>It is through the process of intervention that the worker and the client implement the assessment and the plan that emerged after completing the assessment. The intervention undertaken is directed at meeting the client’s needs as determined by the worker and the client together. In the intervention stage, the client shares with the social worker any information regarding what progress has been made in resolving the problem that is confronting the client.</p>
                                        <p>During this stage, the social worker</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">establishes a rapport with the client,</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">accompanies the client to meetings with other support personnel as needed (e.g., employment counsellors),</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">provides advice and support to the client,</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">adjusts the intervention based on further information from the client, and</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">helps the client to resolve the problem or situation by providing new knowledge and skills that assist in alleviating the problem or that shift the client’s relationship to the problem in beneficial ways.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The intervention phase should focus on creating an ongoing dialogue between the client and the worker and perhaps others involved in the situation. In cases where the uncertainties loom large or are numerous, it is advisable to take small, cautious steps and then reflect on the intervention. This will allow for an enhanced understanding of the situation and an opportunity for the worker and the client to alter the course of action to suit current realities as they come to light.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><a href="#" id="page-117" class="ch-link">The Evaluation and Termination Stage</a></p>
                                        <p>In this, the final stage, the client and the social worker achieve a resolution or a partial resolution to the problem, preferably one that prevents the situation from occurring again. The social worker evaluates the following items with the client:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the choice of intervention</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the length of the intervention</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the frequency of the meetings between client and worker</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the outcome or outcomes of the intervention</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">the need for any follow-up meetings or actions</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">when to terminate the intervention</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Evaluation is an ongoing part of the process. Evaluation should identify a rationale for the actions chosen, whether or not a client’s needs were met, the expected and unexpected effects, and alternative courses of action that may need to be taken.</p>
                                        <p>Increasingly, there is recognition of the benefits of client participation: clients can have an insider’s perspective on agency functioning; information can be validated; confidentiality can be examined; plans can be adjusted; knowledge can be gained; the client–worker relationship can be strengthened; and clients can be empowered.</p>
                                        <p>Termination, or the ending of the client–worker relationship, occurs ideally when the action plan has been completed and the client’s goals have been met. In this stage, essential records are organized and stored in a place of safekeeping.</p>
                                        <p>The use of records raises concerns about the confidentiality of sensitive information: What constitutes the ethical disclosure of information about a client? In addressing this question, social workers are obligated to follow the guidelines of the agency or organization employing them. They must also obey legislation and association policy. The CASW Code of Ethics stipulates, at length, the requirements for collecting, recording, storing, and accessing client records.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers must ensure that appropriate supports are in place before the intervention is ended. A client who has become dependent on assistance and interaction with the social worker may have difficulties with termination. Helping clients build their own support network is crucial. Such support may come from family and friends, informal helpers, self-help groups, or through community or voluntary activities. If an empowerment perspective is embraced, termination often proceeds more smoothly.</p>

                <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
                    <p>While casework had been defined as a method by the early twentieth century, group work and community&#8239;work (or community organizing) were latecomers to the profession. Group work was basically seen as an informal and unstructured activity and not part of the profession (Goldstein, 1973: 26). The focus was on helping people participate collectively in grappling with common problems. Ellen Mesbur (2002) notes that it was not until the 1930s that group work was considered a method of practice. During the Great Depression, social action came to be viewed as a significant and accepted part of the social work profession, and it involved helping and supporting destitute farmers, unemployed labourers, and orphaned children. This was also the period when self-help groups started to develop; people dealing with similar issues came together to support and aid each other. Over the past 50 years or so, the profession has identified group work as one of the models of practice in social work, with a growing body of literature and research available on the subject.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Group Dynamics</p>
                    <p>Although there are many similarities between helping people in a group setting and assisting them one-on-one, there are some significant differences. These elements are sometimes referred to as <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-6">group dynamics</span>. Group dynamics include how people talk and interact with each other in the group (communication and interactive patterns), a sense of belonging to the group (cohesion), and the influence that a group has on individual members to conform to certain behaviours, practices, and beliefs (Toseland and Rivas, 2005: 65). The purpose for which a group is established will in large measure influence its dynamics.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Communication patterns.</span> Depending on the overall objectives of the group, a facilitator will seek to establish a particular communication pattern. For example, in an educational group, the facilitator will have a central role in conveying information to the group; in many parenting groups, the facilitator will systematically present course materials followed by group discussion; in a support/therapeutic group, the facilitator generally aims to have free-floating communication rather than setting up the group so that it is leader-centred.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Cohesion.</span> Cohesion is an important component to be aware of when working with a group. When group members feel connected to the other members in the group, they are more likely to benefit from the group experience. A sense of cohesion in a group provides safety and sets the stage for group members to interact in an authentic way with each other. This sense of connectedness is possibly the most important ingredient in making a group a valuable experience for its members. It is also what motivates people to continue participating in the group.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Group influence and conformity.</span> Group influence and conformity will affect how well a group will function and whether it will be able to achieve the purpose for which it was established. Groups in which members have many common characteristics and hold shared values and expectations are groups that tend to move forward more quickly in achieving group goals. For example, a group of parents of adolescents who have dropped out of school might have many similar goals and will thus be able to support one another. However, part of the strength of groups also lies in members&rsquo; differences. Different experiences and backgrounds can provide perspectives and insights that are new to other group members. The balance between homogeneity and heterogeneity in a group&rsquo;s membership will affect the functioning of the group and how influential it will be on individual members.</li>

                    <p>Group work can be defined as assisting a collection of people who are dealing generally with a similar problem or issue. Groups can be peers, a family, or a therapeutic group. Group work approaches range from therapeutic to educational to activist. Similarly, some communities want to take a healing or therapeutic approach to their problems, others want to learn skills, and some want to head to the streets in protest.</p>
                    <p> A wide range of groups operate in most communities. Whether a group considers itself a community or not, the approaches that are described in this section are helpful for working with any collective of people as they try to create change in their lives.</p>
                    <p>Groups generally fall into the following five categories: self-help, educational, support/therapeutic, task, and social action groups.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Self-help groups.</span> Self-help groups are ones that do not have a professional facilitator and may be either leaderless, have a rotating leader, or designate a leader from within the group. Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the most well-known and longest running self-help groups. Many others have been established, such as PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) and CanSurmount, a peer group for cancer patients and their families. There is also a growing number of web-based support groups, which can be useful for people who are not able to connect with a community group. However, online groups do have limitations&mdash;for example, health information online is not subject to the same scrutiny as information in printed medical journals. There are also privacy concerns related to Internet-based groups.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Educational groups.</span> Educational groups have a primary focus on education, but might also have a support aspect. Examples are groups for heart and stroke victims, parenting groups, and groups for families in which there has been a recent diagnosis of diabetes. These groups usually have a leader who has expertise on the topic.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Support/therapeutic groups.</span> In support/therapeutic groups, the primary purpose is supporting people dealing with specific problems. These are groups that have a professional facilitator. Examples are groups for victims of sexual abuse, women empowerment groups, and groups for people dealing with mental health issues or substance use disorders.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Task groups.</span> In task groups, the primary focus is to accomplish a specific mandate. Although social support may be a side benefit, it is not the primary purpose for which the group was designed. Some examples are a group that coordinates settlement services for newcomers in a community or a personnel committee charged with the task of hiring an executive director for a non-profit organization.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Social action groups.</span> Social action groups tend, as the name implies, to focus on broader social issues, although they may have a personal dimension to them as well. For example, a group organized to ban the use of pesticides on lawns may have been sparked by a personal concern around a child&rsquo;s cancer diagnosis. These groups are part of community organizing. A premise for social action groups is often the need for equitable distribution of resources, whether locally or globally.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>While task groups and social action groups share common aspects with self-help, educational, and support/therapeutic groups, and although many of the skills involved in leading these groups are similar, the focus and emphasis are different for each type of group.</p>

                        <p class="text--caption">A talking stick is often used by First Nations to ensure that everyone’s message and opinions are heard by the group, but it can be used in a variety of social work groups.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">The group usually positions itself in a circle without any obstructions in the middle. A stick or feather (or almost any object) serves as the talking stick. Each group member can speak only when he or she is holding the stick. The speaker passes the stick to the next person who wishes to speak.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">This method ensures that everyone can contribute without interruption, and encourages shy members to participate.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey"><a href="#" id="page-120" class="ch-link">Group Facilitation Skills</a></p>
                    <p>The skills related to working with individuals (mentioned earlier in this chapter) are also the skills required when working with groups: active listening, expressions of empathy, questioning, paraphrasing, reflecting, summarizing, providing information or suggestions, building consensus, and interpreting or reframing ideas. In addition to these skills, however, there are specific group facilitation skills that are important to learn. Some of the main group facilitation skills are described below.</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Connecting.</span> This skill involves linking what one person is saying or doing to what another member in the group is experiencing. The facilitator listens for common themes in people&rsquo;s specific stories and draws meaningful connections. For example, one person&rsquo;s story about losing a job may lead to a discussion of how others in the group have dealt with similar losses that they have experienced. Connecting is an especially important skill in terms of building group cohesion. Part of the effectiveness of groups lies in the support that people receive from recognizing that they are not the only ones dealing with a particular concern. Drawing connections dispels feelings of isolation and helps build group cohesion, moving the group toward mutual aid.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Focusing on process.</span> Process is critical in group work, but it often gets overlooked when the facilitator becomes too engaged in the content of the discussion. While the content may be interesting and important, it is frequently the process that is the most important issue to attend to in a group. Groups are a microcosm of the larger society. How members react to one another can serve to reveal how they treat others outside the group. Helping people to examine their interactions and reactions in the here-and-now can provide an opportunity for gaining insight into the self. Focusing on process includes pointing out patterns to the group and reframing issues. Shulman (1992) notes that the group facilitator has to consider two clients at all times, both the individuals in the group and the group as a whole. This requires the worker to use a microscopic lens and a wide-angle lens&#160;simultaneously, metaphorically speaking.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Cueing.</span> Cueing is another skill that is specific to group work. Here, the facilitator scans the group, takes its pulse, as it were, and becomes instrumental in inviting silent or non-participating members to engage in the group process. This might be done non-verbally through body language (e.g., by making appropriate eye contact with the person you are inviting into the conversation). At other times, it can be done verbally (e.g., by specifically inviting someone to make a comment). When one member is dominating the discussion, it is often useful to take the time to invite members to take turns contributing to the discussion. Engaging with all members will help bring about the attainment of the group&rsquo;s objectives.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Supporting.</span> The facilitator&rsquo;s judgement is required to determine when to support a group member. Jumping in too early might prevent the member from fully exploring a situation and learning from it. This skill also incorporates encouraging group members to support each other. For example, many people come to treatment groups because they feel powerless, hopeless, or isolated. The phenomenon of feeling like you are all &ldquo;in the same boat&rdquo; is one of the healing aspects of a group. In a cohesive and healthy group, members will frequently support each other by sharing similar feelings, thus making the feelings less frightening or overwhelming. The social worker can also encourage empathic statements by asking the group, for example, &ldquo;Has anybody else in the group had similar feelings?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can anybody else relate to what was just said?&rdquo;</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-121" class="ch-link">Blocking.</span> In addition to supporting, a facilitator must also decide when to challenge a group</a> member. Harmful things can be said in groups and, as much as possible, the group facilitator must try to block certain comments or activities in order to maintain the safety of the group. This requires sensitivity and the ability to use power effectively without disempowering group members. Situations in which the facilitator should block discussion include the following: if a member is betraying confidences; making racist, sexist, homophobic, or other discriminatory comments; or being abusive and disrespectful. It is the responsibility of the group facilitator to ensure the safety of all members of the group by establishing rules of conduct prior to each group session and ensuring that the rules are upheld by everyone.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Demonstrating social empathy.</span> While expressing empathy means understanding and validating a client&rsquo;s feelings, social empathy takes this notion a step further. Here, the facilitator makes links between personal troubles and structural issues. Connecting the personal and the political can be very affirming for clients. By providing a social and political context for group members&rsquo; experiences, the facilitator reframes their issues so members can shift from feeling worthless or frustrated (for example, with being unemployed) to feeling empowered. Generally, the facilitator will ask questions that help individual group members make those larger connections in their own lives, for example: &ldquo;In whose interest is it that women stay at home and care for their children (or older parents)?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What seems to get in the way of you getting what you want?&rdquo; The expression of social empathy highlights various oppressions, but it also underlines the fact that the same circumstances may affect individuals in the group in different ways. Context is everything. This is an example of what is meant by the social work phrase &ldquo;person in environment.&rdquo;</li>

                                        <p>Groups do not proceed systematically or in a linear manner through stages. Rather, they typically move back and forth between stages. For example, while conflict is usually associated with the early stages of group formation, conflicts may arise during the later phases as well, if members challenge each other or the basic framework of the group.</p>
                                        <p>Different theoreticians have conceptualized group development in various ways, although there is substantial agreement. Shulman (1992), for example, has outlined group development as having three general phases: beginning, middle, and end. Others have suggested that groups go through five or six stages consisting basically of orientation, conflict, negotiation, functioning, and termination (Toseland and Rivas, 2005: 87).</p>
                                        <p>Bruce Tuckman’s (1965) early work on the stages of group development continues to be a useful approach. He outlined the stages in an easy-to-remember way: forming, storming, norming, and performing, and he later added adjourning to that list (Tuckman and Jensen, 1977).</p>

                                    </aside> -->
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Forming Stage</p>
                                        <p>The forming stage has two primary components: planning the group and getting the group started.</p>
                                        <p>In planning a group, it is vitally important that the purpose is clearly defined (e.g., to provide support, to educate, or to accomplish a specific task). The purpose should be broad enough to attract a sufficient number of people with somewhat varying needs, and yet specific enough to define the common nature of the group. The facilitator should also think about whom the group is intended to attract. In other words, for whom is the group designed? Knowing the group’s objective helps the social worker in the screening process to determine who is appropriate to join the group.</p>
                                        <p>Part of planning also includes issues such as the length of the group meetings, the frequency with which the group meets, and the duration of the group. It is also important at this stage to consider whether the group will be open to new members along the way or whether it will be a closed group.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Storming Stage</p>
                                        <p>The storming stage occurs when conflict emerges in the group. Differences in members’ understanding of the group’s purpose and the group members’ roles and expectations can lead to friction. If it is a voluntary group, members may decide not to return at this stage.</p>
                                        <p>This is the time when members test and challenge the authority of the facilitator. Although this can be a difficult phase in the life of a group, it is also a time when growth can occur and when relationships can be established and strengthened.</p>
                                        <p>By anticipating conflict, group leaders can help members to view conflict as a natural or helpful part of group development and as an opportunity to gather information and share views and opinions rather than as a personal attack.</p>
                                        <p>It is at this stage that the facilitator can be highly influential in establishing a tone for the group and modelling the essential ground rules. This modelling might involve encouraging members to own their statements, listen without interrupting others, ask questions or take time to reflect before reacting in a “knee-jerk” manner, and addressing and responding to each other in a respectful manner.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><a href="#" id="page-123" class="ch-link">The Norming Stage</a></p>
                                        <p>In the norming stage, group norms (expectations, standards, or common practices) and roles become more clearly defined, and members establish a sense of trust with each other. Group cohesion increases, and the group moves toward working on the agreed-upon objectives. One example of a useful norm to establish is that everyone has a right to be heard. It is also useful to encourage members to talk directly to each other rather than communicating through the facilitator.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Performing Stage</p>
                                        <p>In this stage, the group members work toward achieving the outlined goals. Trust and a sense of confidence with each other are evident. Members might disclose painful personal issues from their past and seek assistance and support from each other. Group cohesion is strong, and group participation is lively, with attendance at sessions generally high.</p>
                                        <p>During this stage, individuals begin to consider other group members as friends and feel a sense of connectedness to each other and to the group facilitator. The role of the facilitator is largely one of maintaining a safe and supportive environment for the group members. The facilitator will refocus the group should members get off track. This is the stage in which both the members and the facilitator feel rewarded for their efforts.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The Adjourning Stage</p>
                                        <p>The adjourning stage occurs when the group moves toward termination. Group members may start disengaging from each other. Some members may express increased anxiety about the group ending, while others might deal with the group’s termination by participating less actively or attending group sessions more sporadically.</p>
                                        <p>Groups come to an end for a variety of reasons. For example, some groups have a fixed timeline, and when the eight or twelve sessions are completed, the group is finished. A group may also terminate because its goals have been met and people are ready to move on. A group may also fall apart and disintegrate because members are no longer committed to the purpose for which the group was established. Part of the work of the facilitator is to assist the members in ending the group together positively.</p>
                                        <p>One of the tasks of termination is evaluating the group experience. Evaluation can be done either in a formal way, in which the facilitator systematically collects information at the beginning, middle, and end of the group, or in an informal way. For example, group members might be asked in the final session to identify what was valuable about the group and what they found to be less helpful.</p>

                    <p>In social work, we generally think about <span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-7">community</span> as a group of people who share either a geographic space (e.g., a neighbourhood), an identity (e.g., people with disabilities), or an interest (e.g., social activist communities) (Lee, 1999). Communities also require a consciousness of themselves as a community. For example, while people may share a geographic space or an identity, if they do not think of themselves as a community, then generally we regard them as a group of people who lack a sense of community.</p>
                    <p>As social workers, we are very interested in helping people organize into communities because we know that a sense of community is often helpful for decreasing isolation, sharing resources, and facilitating a sense of self-efficacy, and because communities are often an effective defense against oppression and exploitation. People who have a greater sense of community tend to have a better overall sense of health and well-being.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">People, Acting Together</p>
                    <p>As you read previously, one of the first and most well-known community organizers was Jane Addams, who helped to bring the idea of the settlement house to the United States from Britain. Those involved in the settlement house movement helped to ensure that social work included social activism and bringing people together to meet their own needs more effectively. Jane Addams&rsquo;s work at Hull House in Chicago reflects much of what continues to be integral to community practice today. The women of Hull House created a community space where people could come together, share their concerns, and begin to develop solutions to their problems. The work of Hull House also included research with communities to obtain empirical evidence regarding their challenges, which was in turn used to pressure politicians and city officials to create change and to fulfill people&rsquo;s needs more adequately. Many of the programs at Hull House focused on meeting the needs of women and children, who were considered the heart of the community. When traditional pathways for creating change were not available, the women of Hull House worked with the citizens of east downtown Chicago to hold public protests calling for legislative and policy changes.</p>
                    <p>Underlying community work is the belief that people acting together have the capacity to improve their own circumstances. Those involved have first-hand knowledge of their situation and what is needed to change things for the better. This belief reflects the fundamental values of the social work profession itself. Community social workers are engaged in expanding community awareness, in leadership development, in building alliances, in education, in collaboration, and in building community capacity. They are often involved in social movements and issues such as homelessness, and in various social programs and research.</p>
                    <p>Today, this balance of developing programs, creating community space and resources, completing research, and agitating for political change remains central to community work. It often takes place in community health centres, within city governments, or in various non-profit agencies in a community. Even larger bureaucracies such as Children&rsquo;s Aid Societies often employ a community worker to help build more effective community relations.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of different approaches to community development. Each tends to work better in particular situations, with particular people, and around specific issues. It is helpful to know what approaches are available so that you can find one that fits your personal style and the community with which you are working.</p>

                    <p>In the 1960s, Jack Rothman summarized community work as fitting into three distinct types.</p>
                    <p>Locality development. Locality development includes those approaches to community organizing that focus on issues relevant to a particular neighbourhood or geographic space. Its focus is on engaging a wide number of community participants. Consensus is built by establishing common interests, and community members are encouraged to become leaders. This approach is exemplified by the settlement house movement and, today, by community health centres. The focus of change tends to be municipal governments, external developers, and sometimes provincial and federal governments. Social workers who use this approach often see their role as one of educating people, facilitating conversations, and organizing community members to pursue specific goals.</p>
                    <p>Social planning. Social planning is an expert-driven approach to community work, which can often be found in social planning councils and city planning departments. While community members are involved to varying degrees in making this process work, the experts (social workers, public health workers, or social planners) tend to facilitate meetings and write any reports that emerge from the process. This approach focuses mainly on the technical aspects of achieving tasks and allocating resources. It is not about changing society, but about how to meet immediate needs. Social workers in this type of community work often take on the role of researcher, proposal writer, or communications manager.</p>
                    <p>Social action. Social action is an activist approach to community work seen in many social movements, such as the anti-globalization movement, the feminist movement, and the anti-racist movement. This approach often uses social protest to challenge injustices. A social action approach to community work aims to redistribute power, resources, and decision making. Generally, it involves organizing people who are marginalized from the decision-making process, but it can also focus on the general public. The aim is to build political power and to create institutional change. Social workers who engage in this type of community work are often advocates, facilitators, organizers, and researchers.</p>

In Rules for Radicals, he wrote that the job of the organizer is to “maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a ‘dangerous enemy.’”</p>

                    <p>Saul Alinsky is sometimes called &ldquo;the father of community organizing.&rdquo; Alinsky was very effective in organizing communities in the United States from the 1930s to the 1960s. He also travelled to Canada to work with Aboriginal peoples.</p>
                    <p>Alinsky&rsquo;s approach was confrontational and strategic. Alinsky was largely concerned with strategies to win battles for marginalized communities. He spoke of community organizing as a process of going to war (Alinsky, 1971). This masculine language often alienated women and peace activists, but many groups have successfully adapted his methods to fit their own agendas. Alinsky was not only concerned with battling the power holders to demand distribution of resources, but he was also very effective at building community organizations, which he saw as instrumental in making community work sustainable. Thus, his approach is a balance between creating long-term activist organizations and planning short-term, exciting challenges to power holders.</p>
                    <p>One of the most helpful insights that Alinsky brought to organizing is the notion that community work needs to be fun&mdash;people only like to get involved with tactics that are enjoyable and do not drag on too long (Stall and Stoeker, 1998).</p>
                    <p>He was also well aware that an organizer needs to plan tactics that are within the experience of the community members and outside the experience of those people that you are organizing against. He understood how powerful the element of surprise is for communities who challenge power holders.</p>
                    <p>Alinsky did not feel that democratic capitalism itself needed to be challenged, but he did believe in creating confrontation to redistribute resources within that system (Alinsky, 1971). He was disdainful of idealistic approaches to community work, feeling that it was important to start where people were at, and to create a vision that was fundamentally built within the existing social structures. His approach to organizing is still widely used in North America today.</p>

                    <p>Paulo Freire was an educator in Brazil in the 1950s, and his work is significant in the shaping of contemporary community work, not to mention education theory and practice. In Brazil he worked to develop a national education system at a time when poor Brazilians were starting to realize that they needed to challenge the oppression they were facing. In this revolutionary context, Freire developed a radical approach to education that is applicable to community&#160;practice.</p>
                    <p>Freire criticized the &ldquo;banking&rdquo; approach to education, whereby an educator stands in front of a group of people who stay silent and quickly copy down everything the educator says. Freire argued that this makes people into passive objects. Instead, he developed an approach to education in which the educator asks the community members questions about their lives; in critically exploring their lives, people also learn to read and write.</p>
                    <p>When the questions asked by a facilitator are relevant to people&rsquo;s lives, they learn easily. At the same time, they develop a collective, critical consciousness of their lives and the challenges they are facing.</p>
                    <p>Freire&rsquo;s education system was highly effective, but it was perceived as a threat to the country&rsquo;s power holders, many of whom relied on the peasants&rsquo; acquiescence to being exploited. As a result, Freire was exiled in 1964 after a military coup in Brazil. In the 1960s and 1970s, Freire taught at universities in the United States and Britain and helped with education reform in former Portuguese colonies in Africa. He returned to Brazil to continue his work in the 1980s.</p>
                    <p>A Freirian approach to community work begins with a listening survey. The community organizer goes into the community and talks to people, knocking on doors and visiting people at bus stops, in laundromats, and at other common gathering places. While doing this, the organizer tries to find out what community members feel strongly about&mdash;either positive aspects of their lives or negative ones.</p>
                    <p>Next, the organizer and a small group of community members&mdash;called a learning group&mdash;gather together to go through the findings of the listening survey, making codes from the ideas they have heard. Codes can be pictures, films, images, or plays that represent the issues the community feels strongly about. These codes are then presented to the community to stimulate discussion about what is going well or badly in the community and to stimulate action planning with a view to creating change (Hope and Timmel, 1984).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Freire&rsquo;s Concept of &ldquo;Praxis&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>What is integral to a Freirian approach to social change is a process of reflection and action called &ldquo;praxis.&rdquo; Freire believed that a successful action for social change must be reflected upon both in advance of the action and afterward, thereby creating new and more effective actions, which are also then reflected upon.</p>
                    <p>Freire argued that his approach would encourage thoughtful actions rather than reactive responses to injustice, which are often contradictory and difficult to sustain. For example, when some revolutionary movements achieve power, they can be just as oppressive as the power holders they overthrew.</p>
                    <p>Freire&rsquo;s approach to community work and community education is fundamentally committed to people becoming empowered to create a social justice revolution.</p>

Freire’s work laid the foundation for what is now called “critical pedagogy.”</p>

                    <p><span class="text--red span-keyword" id="kc-8">Community capacity building</span> is an approach that originated in the United States and that was spearheaded by John McKnight and John Kretzmann. It is a contemporary approach to community organizing that has become popular both nationally and internationally. McKnight and Kretzmann believe that it is vitally important to develop an approach to community work that builds upon the strengths and assets of a community rather than focusing on the community&rsquo;s needs. They also argue that communities should develop their own resources to meet their needs rather than relying heavily on state programs, which are stigmatizing and create a destructive dependency (McKnight and Kretzmann, 1993).</p>
                    <p>This approach involves assessing the strengths and resources in a community in terms of social relationships, people&rsquo;s gifts and skills, local businesses, places of worship, and community space. Generally, organizers using this approach create a map of these strengths and resources, which is the foundation from which community members work to further develop their assets. This approach is particularly powerful for communities in which people need to become more aware of their potential.</p>
                    <p>One possible limitation of this approach is that some communities are so resource-poor that they are unable to deal with their problems without state support. Some argue that a more rights-focused approach to community work is necessary, one that demands state institutions be accountable for meeting the needs of marginalized communities, rather than simply encouraging communities to meet their own needs (McGrath et al., 1999).</p>

                    <p>Feminist and women-centred approaches to community development are not linked to a particular person, but rather are ways of organizing that have been identified with feminist and women&rsquo;s organizing throughout the twentieth century. This style of organizing was developed by working-class women, Black women activists, lesbian activists, and middle-class white women. While it does not necessarily exclude men, it often focuses on women as key to their communities and on the notion that meeting women&rsquo;s needs impacts positively on families and the community more broadly (Stall and Stoeker, 1998).</p>

                    <p>Feminist and women-centred approaches to community organizing tend to rely on consensus decision making, shared leadership, and a process orientation (Adamson et al., 1988). To achieve its ends, the activist group uses methods that are consistent with their goals. This model tends to focus on creating concrete changes in the experiences of women and communities and is often used to establish community kitchens, playgrounds, co-operative childcare, shelters for abused women, and sexual assault centres. This approach usually involves a great deal of peer education, or consciousness raising. One of the limits of this approach is that it can take some time, so it is not always the most appropriate approach when decisive action is needed. It is also geared to more long-term changes involving small groups of citizens coming&#160;together.</p>
                    <p>As one example of vibrant, feminist-based community work, the Concordia University-based Centre for Gender Advocacy in Montr&eacute;al is an independent, student-funded advocacy organization that promotes gender equality and empowerment, especially as it relates to marginalized communities. Its programs include Missing Justice (for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women); a Sexual Assault Centre Campaign; Reproductive Justice; and Trans Health Advocacy. The Centre believes that gender oppression is inextricably linked to social and economic justice. The Centre works within a feminist framework to challenge these systemic oppressions by</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Another approach to community work looks at the building of community as a healing practice (sometimes linked to spirituality). From this perspective, community members draw on community traditions and values as part of a process of healing. This reconnection to traditional values and practices is seen as an important way to deal with problems such as family breakdown, suicide, substance use disorders, and histories of abuse.</p>
                    <p>This healing approach is often used by Indigenous groups and spiritual communities. Members of these communities are encouraged and supported to find a path to wellness. This approach to community work can help people remove internal obstacles to meaningful participation in society and bring about genuine healing for the individuals involved, but it tends not to focus as much on the structural inequalities that may also exist in a particular context.</p>

                                            <p>Bill Lee (1999) breaks down community work into a series of discrete phases. While these phases do not always occur in a linear fashion, they provide an idea of the process that constitutes community work. The following phases are similar to those outlined by Lee in his book, Pragmatics of Community&#160;Organizing (2011).</p>
                                        </blockquote>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Pre-Entry</p>
                                        <p>The job of a community worker begins even before entering a community, in a process identified as pre-entry. Often before having contact with a community, a social worker is hired by a funder to complete a project. While it is preferable to begin work at the community’s direct request, it is rare that communities have sufficient resources to do this. As a result, there are tasks that the social worker can do to help prepare to collaborate effectively with community members.</p>
                                        <p>A social worker who is hired by a funding organization to work in a local community needs to spend time learning the general history of the community and its relationship with the funder before entering the community. He or she also needs to have a sense of the politics of the community, how the community’s problems are perceived by a diverse group of its members, and whether this differs from the funder’s understanding of the problems.The social worker also needs to understand the length of time available to do the work and what outcomes are expected (and whether the community has any input into these outcomes). This type of preparation work is vital to ensuring that an organizer is able to create a helpful beginning for the community process.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Contact and Engagement</p>
                                        <p>The next stage of community work is contact and engagement. It is in this phase that the community organizer starts to meet community members, listens to how they feel about their community, and begins to engage them in a process of change.</p>
                                        <p>Engagement is often a long and challenging process in which the organizer works to build trusting relationships with as representative a sample of the community as possible. In this phase, the worker also tries to support people in developing a sense of hope that things can change.</p>
                                        <p>The most challenging part of this and of later stages in community practice is that rather than doing all the work necessary to organize and create change, a social worker is always trying to support the community to do the work themselves. This often requires that the worker take a slow and often winding approach to reaching goals.</p>
                                        <p>The key issues in contact and engagement are significantly shaped by whether the community worker is perceived as an insider or an outsider to the community and by the amount of trust that develops between the organizer and community members. Being a community outsider presents a different set of challenges in this phase than those presented when one is a community insider. In either situation, the building of trust, broad participation, and hope that change is possible are key.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Community Analysis</p>
                                        <p>Since the days of the settlement movement, it has been clear that in order to create lasting social change, a community must understand itself and develop a process to gain information about what is happening to its members. The most common approach used to achieve this is participatory action research (PAR), where community members are involved in deciding the research questions, determining the research process, and analyzing the research data.</p>
                                        <p>Through this process two important things happen: first, community members develop skills, and second, the community gets the evidence they need to encourage power holders to listen to their demands and create change. It is far harder to ignore a community group armed with data to support their position than it is a group that is simply presenting opinions or their unique perspective.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Organizational Development</p>
                                        <p>The next important phase of community work is to help the community get organized and develop roles and responsibilities that people can take on to facilitate change. For example, a community association may elect board members through biannual elections in which anyone who lives within certain community boundaries can vote. Sometimes communities hire a part-time staff person to help develop community programs. Other communities rely on a large number of volunteers who make decisions as a collective. In either situation, the roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes need to be clear and agreed upon.</p>
                                        <p>It is important in this phase (and in all phases of community practice) that social workers work with people, not for them. If we support community members in doing the work to create <a href="#" id="page-133" class="ch-link">change, they learn skills and become more confident, and this</a> can often help build solidarity. If a community worker does everything, then all the community learns is to be dependent on that worker. Working with people, not for them, can be difficult at times. It requires patience, and sometimes we have to let people make their own mistakes, but it is only by doing so that communities can do the learning that helps them become more confident in their decisions and processes.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Action Planning and Mobilization</p>
                                        <p>After a group has become organized, it is time to begin to plan actions and mobilize. The most important predictor of success at the action planning and mobilization stage is the amount of community support for any action.</p>
                                        <p>Any plan for moving forward relies upon people building consensus around a clear plan in which everyone knows what goals are being pursued, how long it will take to achieve these goals, and how the community is going to attain these goals. If a community is deeply divided, it is difficult to launch a successful action. There are usually three approaches to action planning. The first involves co-operating with power holders. If that approach is unsuccessful, groups can launch various types of issue-raising campaigns. If such campaigns don’t effect change, the third approach is confrontation.</p>
                                        <p>Key to any successful action is media coverage. Again, this requires substantial work prior to an action. Relationships need to be built with the media, and care has to be put into ensuring that the action is, in itself, media-worthy. Are there visuals for television cameras and social media? Does the group have a clear message that is easily grasped by an audience who is unfamiliar with the issue? Are the community members prepared to speak to the media? Does everyone know how to stick to the message? Do you have information for reporters so that they have the facts and the background?</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Conflict Resolution</p>
                                        <p>Another key component of community work is trying to mediate conflicts either within the community or with parties outside the community. In this process, a community worker needs to be aware of what is at stake in a conflict in terms of process, emotions, and content. To resolve conflict, an impartial person may need to be brought in to help each side clarify its position and to search for possible compromises. There are many different resources, workshops, and certificate programs to help social workers develop their conflict resolution skills.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Evaluation</p>
                                        <p>One of the final stages of community practice involves evaluation, which allows a community to reflect upon whether they were able to achieve the goals that they set for themselves. A final evaluation is most effective when evaluation has been an ongoing component of the community work. Sometimes it is driven by a funder who wants a report on outcomes, but evaluations can also provide a useful opportunity for communities to reflect upon what they have achieved and to enhance their enthusiasm and confidence for future projects.</p>
                                        <p>Social work with communities often addresses the same problems that individual- or family-focused counsellors deal with, but it takes a slightly different approach, looking at problems as something that a group of people experience. Community social workers go to great effort to identify people’s common experiences and to build upon them to create effective community groups capable of creating change for themselves. As they do so, community groups often gain valuable skills and are more able to effect change. And increasingly, they develop a sense that they can influence their environment and improve their lives. With this lived experience, they are armed with the skills and confidence to challenge those who exploit them, and to imagine and create a better future for themselves.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey text--center">Susan Macphail was one of the founders of a women’s resource centre in London, Ontario. It was an idea so new to the city at the time that “We actually didn’t know what we were going to do. I got hired as a feminist counsellor and I had no idea what that would be.”</p>

                            <p class="text--bold">My Sisters&rsquo; Place is a day shelter, counselling service, and agency for change for homeless and at-risk women. At My Sisters&rsquo; Place, the women who seek assistance&mdash;as well as those who offer it&mdash;are empowered by programs that build on women&rsquo;s many strengths.</p>
                            <p>Susan Macphail is the director of My Sisters&rsquo; Place, a women&rsquo;s program centre located in London, Ontario. The centre offers more than two dozen programs for marginalized women. These services are provided by staff, by volunteers, and sometimes by outside agency personnel.</p>
                            <p>Those individuals offering services at My Sisters&rsquo; Place range from having no formal training to having extensive professional training, including social work education. The helping relationship&mdash;which includes warmth, empathy, and genuineness&mdash;is centrally important to effective social work with individuals. A helping relationship can be demonstrated by volunteers, peers, and professionals. My Sisters&rsquo; Place provides an excellent example of effective social work with individuals, groups, and the larger community.</p>
                            <p>At My Sisters&rsquo; Place, social work that benefits individuals includes clinical mental health counselling, case work, First Nations counselling, information sharing about resources, and physical health services. Women who visit the centre can have lunch, take a shower, sleep in a day bed, use the house telephone, meet with a support worker, access the services of a social worker, and see a nurse practitioner. Staff and volunteers who engage with the women often conduct either formal or informal intakes, assessments, and collaborative planning to help the women reorganize their lives.</p>
                            <p>The centre offers groups focused on anger management, healthy relationships, mindfulness, gardening, and art therapy. Women have the opportunity to both give and receive support from each other. Educational, support, task, and social action groups are all available at My Sisters&rsquo; Place, and social action groups connect the agency with the larger community.</p>
                            <p>My Sisters&rsquo; Place liaises with the community in a number of ways. There are 27 community partners, including businesses that support a micro enterprise at the centre that makes jewellery. This cooperative group meets behind the main building in what was once an old coach house. This building has been restored, and is now used to give women the opportunity to create jewellery and accessories to sell to customers.</p>
                            <p>Other community services include engaging the east-end London neighbourhood in community development and capacity building focused on affordable housing and day care.</p>
                            <p>The centre&rsquo;s work is informed by a number of converging ideas, such as feminism, strengths-based practice, a pro-LGBTQ+ orientation, women-centeredness, anti-oppressive practice, respect for First Nations, a rational-cultural model, an emphasis on community development, and a focus on social determinants of mental health. Various theories inform the work, and vice versa.</p>
                            <p>Working with, and not for, people is a centrally important principle at My Sisters&rsquo; Place. The so-called &ldquo;expert&rdquo; who attempts to diagnose clients and devise solutions has no place in this agency. Working with the women, who already have many strengths, empowers those who seek assistance as well as those who offer it.</p>
                            <p>Because the centre has engaged for many years with numerous marginalized women, it has identified some common issues that affect the lives of these women. Concerns related to housing, violence, children, and poverty are uppermost.</p>
                            <p>An important part of the centre&rsquo;s role is to advocate for a national housing strategy, a national plan for violence prevention across the lifespan, national child care, a poverty reduction strategy, and a national minimum wage.</p>

                        <li>Graphic organizers known as “genograms” can be helpful in beginning to understand family dynamics. Do some research about genograms, and then create one for your own family, showing the complex relationships between family members—today and over generations. Show how you and various members of your family interact with people and institutions in ways that might be relevant to a better understanding of your family today.</li>
                        <li>Social work with individuals and families involves the skill of active listening. You have the opportunity to practise this skill every day. Choose a period of time in your week when you are in dialogue and consciously practise active listening. Notice how your perception shifts when you consciously listen. How is it different from your usual form of listening? How would this benefit you in your role as a social worker or social service worker? Record your experience in a two-page report. Be sure to indicate how this technique might be employed in a practice setting.</li>
                        <li>Do some research or draw upon your own experience to describe Bill Lee’s phases of community work in a real-world context. By what means can a social worker try to ensure that community work is effective, positive, long-lasting, and respectful of the needs and goals of community members?</li>
