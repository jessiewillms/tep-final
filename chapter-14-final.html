Social workers have also been and remain involved with the resettling of refugees and other persons displaced by war, operating emergency relief services for victims of natural and human-made disasters, advocating on behalf of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, organizing groups of oppressed people into effective political entities, and otherwise extending various programs of assistance to populations in need. In all these areas, social workers play an indispensable and often unacknowledged role, sometimes working in extremely difficult and dangerous conditions.</p>

                        <p>The term &ldquo;international social work&rdquo; has a number of different meanings. It can refer to the examination and comparison of the social welfare systems in different countries (comparative social welfare). It can also denote work within international organizations, such as governmental or voluntary organizations that carry out social planning, social development, and welfare programs abroad, particularly in underdeveloped regions. Finally, it can simply refer to the day-to-day social work that social workers do with individuals, groups, and communities in a country other than their own.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Protection of Human Rights and Ensuring Sustainable Development</p>
                        <p>Any discussion of international social work must begin by acknowledging the severe economic disadvantages faced by people in the so-called developing world. The globe can be divided, economically speaking, into the Northern and Southern hemispheres, with the industrialized countries of the North living in relative affluence and many of the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">developing countries</span> in the &ldquo;Global South&rdquo; facing abject poverty. Nearly 11 million children under five die each year in these countries, mainly from preventable causes. Malnutrition contributes to 60 percent of all childhood deaths. Combined with preventable diseases, this is a &ldquo;deadly duo.&rdquo; Poverty, of course, is one of the main causes of malnutrition and early death.</p>
                        <p>International social work is varied as well as challenging. It can range from involvement in an international cause in one&rsquo;s own country to working directly in another country to develop a program or policy. In each of these work situations, social workers require knowledge of international relations, other nations&rsquo; social and political contexts, and an understanding of how international social work is practised throughout the world. For example:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A social worker in a women&rsquo;s shelter in Guatemala helps bring in an undocumented immigrant whose life is endangered by an abusive husband.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A social worker with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) helps a community in Sierra Leone deal with an Ebola outbreak.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A group of social workers in a government social assistance department travel to Vietnam to help develop a similar program for its cities.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Social workers with the Red Cross help with disaster relief in remote areas of Nepal.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A social worker provides HIV/AIDS prevention workshops in Botswana.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Social workers with War Child Canada provide trauma counselling to women and children affected by war in Sudan.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Social workers from Canada and Bolivia work together to develop policies that protect children from abuse and neglect.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The opportunities for work are certainly endless. However, given the great inequalities around the world, and the lack of political stability in many countries, even the most dedicated social workers quickly realize that opportunities for bringing about lasting social change are limited. For this reason, social work activists are increasingly advocating an approach based on two complementary principles: (1)&#8239;the promotion and protection of human rights, and (2)&#8239;ensuring sustainable social and economic development.</p>
                        <p>The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) supports its 116 member countries by providing a global voice for the profession. It strives for social justice, human rights, and social development by promoting social work, best practice models, and international cooperation.</p>

                        <p>International social work occurs at home and abroad and in many different contexts and forms. Broadly speaking, international social work occurs in four domains:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Domestic practice with international implications.</span> Social workers can contribute to international causes through work at home&mdash;for example, through refugee settlement and international adoption work. In the latter example, international adoption agencies hire social workers to link prospective parents with overseas agencies, guide them through the process, provide proper matching, and ensure that the child&rsquo;s rights are protected.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">International practice.</span> Social workers can join international development agencies or agencies in other countries to contribute directly in communities around the world. Such workers need a commitment to cross-cultural communication and international development, as well as knowledge of the political and cultural contexts in which they work.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Professional exchange between nations.</span> Social workers often travel to participate in professional exchange opportunities (such as international conferences and trainings). These activities are a growing aspect of social work that help to improve practice and policy.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">International policy work and advocacy.</span> As a worldwide movement, social work has contributed to research and advocacy for international causes, and has influenced governments and organizations on important issues. Cooperation between social workers from different countries is key for policy work that creates lasting positive change.</li>

                        <p>Canada does not exist in isolation from the rest of the world. This is especially true as the era of globalization increasingly takes hold. Whether we like it or not, we live in a highly integrated world economy.</p>
                        <p><span class="text--red span--keyword">Economic globalization</span> is the growing integration of international markets for goods, services, and finance. It includes the expansion of free trade and investment, the geographical expansion and increase in power of transnational corporations (TNCs), and the use of agreements between nations and international bodies such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). There are differing understandings and perceptions as to the social impact of globalization. Some maintain that the present model of globalization has worsened problems of unemployment, inequality, and poverty, while others contend that globalization has helped to reduce them. For globalization to be politically and economically sustainable, it must meet the needs of all sectors of society, contribute to the reduction of inequality, and lead to a better life for all.</p>
                        <p>For poor countries themselves, the most pressing concern remains, of course, basic economic development. What has transpired to date under the banners of &ldquo;globalization&rdquo; and &ldquo;development&rdquo; has often led more to perpetual dependence on aid than to economic liberation. Indeed, many observers would argue that countries in the Third World are not so much &ldquo;developing&rdquo; as &ldquo;underdeveloping.&rdquo; This type of situation contributes to cycles of inequality and socio-political instability.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Challenges for Canadian Social Workers in a Globalized World</p>
                        <p>How can social workers address instability, inequality, and injustice from a global perspective? All social work today is interwoven with global economic processes. Economic interdependence, war, politcal instability, and human migration all have implications for Canadian social work practice. The systems and processes that produce extreme disparities&mdash;in areas such as income, education, health care, and nutrition&mdash;are in constant flux. Canadian social workers need to stay informed about these systems and processes, and how they affect individuals and communities. They need to continually develop their knowledge and skills to deal with global-level problems and serve multicultural societies.</p>
                        <p>Are Western models of social work beneficial to other countries? Or do different cultural norms and social contexts require different models of social work? In any given situation, social workers need to challenge their assumptions, acknowledge their biases, and pay attention to local models of social work practice. Western social work should be influenced by non-Western social work, and vice versa.</p>
                        <p>Social work practice is more equitable and effective when in it incorporates ideas, perceptions, and methods from non-Western cultures. For example, John Graham, a professor at the University of Calgary, found that African perspectives on family and community can contribute to a holistic vision of social work practice&mdash;one that values shared experience and spiritual, family, and community engagement in resolving social and personal hardships.</p>
                        <p>There is a need to find ways to strengthen the status of social work in developing countries as well as in overpopulated countries such as India, China, and Japan. International partnerships that promote mutual respect for the exchange of knowledge between countries are key to achieving a universal social work, one that is based on openness to diverse cultures, accountability, responsiveness, and connectivity (Gray and Fook, 2004).</p>

                        <p>Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity today. The global climate is changing as a result of greenhouse gases caused by fossil fuel consumption, deforestation, and industrial processes. These gases trap infrared radiation and cause changes in air temperature, precipitation patterns, ocean acidity, sea levels, and the rate at which Earth&rsquo;s glaciers are melting.</p>
                        <p>Climate change is a global issue, but its consequences differ across communities, countries, and regions. Social workers are increasingly vocal on environmental issues and are active in climate change policy dialogues. For example, the journal International Social Work released a special issue on climate change in 2015, with articles addressing issues related to water, health, disaster prevention, and sustainability.</p>
                        <p>Social workers are increasingly working in areas such as post-disaster recovery, social support for victims of extreme weather events, crisis intervention, policy development, advocacy, program planning, and research. Dominelli (2011) explores how social work has an important role to play in helping people understand climate change, promoting sustainable energy production and consumption, mobilizing people to protect their futures through community social work, proposing solutions to greenhouse gas emissions, and fostering climate change endeavours that are equitable for all.</p>

                        <p>The Human Development Report (HDR) is an annual, independent report commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It is the product of a team of leading scholars, practitioners, and members of the Human Development Report Office. The HDR was first launched in 1990 with the goal of putting people back at the centre of the development process in terms of economic debate, policy, and advocacy. The Human Development Report goes beyond measuring income as a means of assessing the level of people&rsquo;s long-term well-being, emphasizing that the goals of development are choice and freedom.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Human Development Index (HDI)</p>
                        <p>Since its first report in 1990, the HDR team has developed four composite indices: the Human Development Index (the principal index), the Gender-Related Development Index, the Gender Empowerment Measure, and the Human Poverty Index. In addition to releasing new data from the previous year, each HDR also focuses on a highly topical theme, providing path-breaking analysis and policy recommendations. The Human Development Report Office also issues global, national, and regional reports on topics of the day. The messages of these reports&mdash;as well as the tools to implement them&mdash;have been embraced by people around the world, evidenced by the publication of similar human development reports at the national level in more than 120 countries.</p>
                        <p>While the scope of human development is much broader than any single index can measure, the HDR&rsquo;s principal human development indicator, <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-3">the Human Development Index (HDI)</span>, offers a powerful alternative to using income alone as a measure of human well-being. The HDI focuses on three dimensions of development: (1) a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at birth; (2) knowledge, as measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary, and tertiary schools; and (3) a decent standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity with U.S. dollars.</p>
                        <p>The HDI was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not simply its economic growth. The Human Development Index itself does not claim to be comprehensive&mdash;for example, it does not include important aspects of human development, notably the ability to participate in political decisions. Likewise, it does not capture gender disparity and human deprivation, which are measured in other HDR indices (the Gender-Related Development Index and the Human Poverty Index). Nevertheless, the HDI is a powerful starting point for understanding and advocating for human development.</p>
                        <p>While advances in technology, education, and incomes hold ever-greater promise for longer, healthier, more secure lives, many of those who have escaped absolute poverty are highly vulnerable to setbacks. According to the UN, almost 800 million people worldwide are at risk of falling back into poverty. To capture this dimension, the 2014 Human Development Report introduced the concept of &ldquo;human vulnerability&rdquo; to describe the factors that threaten people&rsquo;s capabilities and choices. Human vulnerability is increasing because of human-made crises, financial instability, and mounting environmental pressures, such as climate change. All of these factors have the potential to undermine progress in human development.</p>

However, like all averages, this measure often masks inequalities in the distribution of human development within the country. In 2010, the UN introduced the new <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI)</span>, which takes into account inequalities in all three dimensions of the HDI. As inequality in a country increases, human development decreases.</p>

However, when this value was discounted for inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices, it fell to 0.832, a loss of 8.8 percent. In the same year, Australia and the United States showed losses due to inequality of 8.2 percent and 17.0 percent, respectively. The average loss due to inequality for countries with high HDI values was 12.1 percent. The average for the 34 countries that are members of the OECD was 13.3 percent.</p>

                        <p>The concept of sustainable development is now becoming central to the programs of many governments, businesses, educational institutions, and non-government organizations around the world. There are many definitions of sustainable development, including the following landmark definition that appeared in Our Common Future (also known as the Brundtland Report) in 1987:</p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>&ldquo;[Sustainable development is] development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p><em>&mdash;World Commission on Environment and Development</em> (the Brundtland Commission)</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Sustainable development is about improving the standard of living by protecting human health, conserving the environment, using resources efficiently, and advancing long-term economic competitiveness. It requires the integration of environmental, economic, and social priorities into policies and programs, and requires action by citizens, industry, and governments.</p>
                        <p>Issues around the world such as inequality, poverty, pollution, and climate change negatively impact our planet and all who inhabit it. Recognizing the importance of these issues, the United Nations (UN) is calling on world leaders to come together to create change.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 2000&ndash;2015</p>
                        <p>In September 2000, building on a decade of major United Nations conferences and summits, world leaders came together at the UN Headquarters in New York to adopt the United Nations Millennium Declaration. The Declaration committed nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty. It also set out eight time-bound targets addressing hunger, disease, gender inequality, and access to water and sanitation. These targets became known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and had a deadline of 2015.</p>
                        <p>The final MDG Report found that this 15-year effort produced the most successful anti-poverty movement in history:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Since 1990, the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined by more than half.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">The proportion of undernourished people in developing regions has fallen by almost half.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">The primary school enrolment rate in developing regions has reached 91 percent, and many more girls are now in school compared to 15 years ago.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Remarkable gains have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">The under-five mortality rate has declined by more than half, and maternal mortality is down 45 percent worldwide.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">The proportion of people who lack access to improved sources of water was cut in half.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These statistics show that the concerted efforts of national governments, the international community, civil society, and the private sector have helped expand hope and opportunity for people around the world. Yet the job remains unfinished for millions of people&mdash;we need to go the last mile toward ending hunger, achieving full gender equality, improving health services, and getting every child into school.</p>
                        <p>There is also an increasingly urgent need to take steps to mitigate both the short-term and long-term effects of climate change on resource distribution, migration patterns, food production, and food security. The mandate now is to shift the world onto a truly sustainable path.</p>

                        <p>At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit on September 25, 2015, world leaders adopted the Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-6">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</span></span> to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030 (see Figure 14.2).</p>
                        <p>The Sustainable Development Goals, otherwise known as the Global Goals, build on the Millennium Development Goals, the eight anti-poverty targets that the world committed to achieving by 2015. The new SDGs and the broader sustainability agenda go much further than the MDGs, however, in addressing the root causes of poverty and the universal need for development that works for all people.</p>
                        <p>Within the 17 SDGs are 169 targets. The targets under Goal 1, for example, include reducing the number of people living in poverty by at least half and eradicating extreme poverty (people living on less than $1.25 USD a day). Goals 2, 3, and 4 involve targets focused on ending hunger, ensuring good health and well-being, and providing quality education, respectively.</p>
                        <p>Under Goal 5, there is a target aimed at eliminating violence against women, while Goal 16 has a target to promote the rule of law and equal access to justice. UN member states will be expected to use the new goals, targets, and indicators to frame their agendas and political and social policies.</p>
                        <p>The SDGs will guide policy and funding for the next 15 years, beginning with the historic pledge taken on September 25, 2015, to end poverty. Everywhere. Permanently.</p>

                        <p>The Western idea of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">human rights</span> is based on an acknowledgment that individuals possess certain inalienable political and civil rights. The concept has its origins in ancient religions and philosophies, and took flight in Europe during the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. It was at the heart of the English, French, and Russion revolutions. In the upheavals of the twentieth century, it was the basis of the movement for universal suffrage, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements, among many others.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</p>
                        <p>The recognition of universal human rights was finally consolidated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. All the major countries of the world are now signatories to this declaration. It consists of 30 articles that have been further elaborated in subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other legislation. While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a non-binding document, it is a foundation document and is often invoked by national and other judiciaries around the world. The declaration has proved to be a powerful instrument in the advancement of individual rights around the world and has been widely used to apply political and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its principles.</p>
                        <p>The notion that there is a duty to protect the rights of all people has become a recognized part of our human heritage. Unfortunately, as everyone knows, individual and collective human rights are not always respected in practice, and the struggle to defend and advance human rights is not over by any means.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Three Types of Rights</p>
                        <p>When thinking about rights, it may be useful to distinguish between three types (or &ldquo;generations&rdquo;) of human rights (see Table 14.2). This broad division was initially set out by the Czech legal scholar Karel Vasak in 1979. Vasak&rsquo;s divisions closely align with the famous watchwords of the French Revolution: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Negative rights (Liberty).</span> The first type of rights represents civil and political rights as set forth in Articles 2 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They pertain to&#160;liberty and political participation and ensure protection from torture, false imprisonment, or summary execution.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Positive rights (Equality).</span> The second type of rights represents economic, social, and cultural rights as detailed in Articles 22 to 27 of the Declaration. These rights are aimed at ensuring justice, freedom from want, and full participation in society. They would include employment rights, housing and health care rights, as well as the right to social security.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Collective rights (Fraternity).</span> The third type encompasses the collective rights contained in Article 28, which states that &ldquo;everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.&rdquo; This category goes beyond formal civil and social rights usually enshrined in national and international law. It would include such things as self-determination, economic and social development, healthy environment, communication, cultural heritage, and sustainability.</li>

                        <p>The concept of human rights gradually gained more prominence in social work in the nineteenth century. Following the two world wars and the great political upheavals and revolutions of the twentieth century, the protection of human rights took on a renewed importance within the profession.</p>
                        <p>The social work profession today is firmly at the forefront of promoting human rights around the world. For example, the International Policy on Human Rights, adopted by the International Federation of Social Work (IFSW), affirms that human rights are a common standard and guide for the work of all social workers. Its preamble states:</p>
                        <p>The history of human rights is that of the struggle against exploitation of one person by another. It is based on the recognition of basic rights founded on the concept of the inherent dignity and worth of every individual.</p>
                        <p>The IFSW emphasizes that social workers not only respect human rights but also work to oppose all violations of human rights. Most practising social workers today see themselves as part of this human rights history and heritage.</p>

                                            <p>There were cheers in the United Nations as Canada officially removed its objector status to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Tuesday, almost a decade after it was adopted by the General Assembly.</p>
                                            <p>“We are now a full supporter of the declaration, without qualification,” [Canada’s Indigenous Affairs Minister] Bennett said, as she addressed the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues at the United Nations in New York City on Tuesday.</p>
                                            <p>“We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution.”</p>
                                            <p>The declaration&#160;recognizes Indigenous Peoples’&#160;basic human rights, as well as rights to self-determination, language, equality and land, among others.</p>
                                            <p>Bennett — who received a standing ovation for her statement&#160;—&#160;is at the United Nations with Justice Minister Jody&#160;Wilson-Raybould.</p>
                                            <p>“It was a very emotional moment for me,” said Chief Wilton Littlechild, a Cree lawyer and former commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada who was at the UN on Tuesday. Littlechild has been involved with the UN for nearly 40 years and said he’s rarely seen anyone receive a standing ovation.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><span>Implementing the declaration</span></p>
                                            <p>Littlechild said today’s announcement marks a beginning to what could be a long process of “harmonizing” Canada’s laws with the standards set in the declaration, and improving the country’s relationship with Indigenous Peoples.</p>
                                            <p>“The declaration is much like the treaties, it calls on us to work together,” he said. “Today would not be too late to start the journey together.”</p>
                                            <p>Bennett told the UN that Canada is in a unique position to implement the declaration.</p>
                                            <p>“Canada is now a full supporter of the [UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples] without qualification,” Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett told the United Nations in New York on Tuesday.</p>
                                            <p>“Through Section 35 of its Constitution, Canada has a robust framework for the protection of Indigenous rights,” she said. </p>
                                            <p>“By adopting and implementing the declaration, we are excited that we are breathing life into Section 35 and recognizing it as a full box of rights for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.”</p>
                                            <p>Bennett also said implementing the UN declaration in Canada will require the full co-operation of Indigenous Peoples and the support of all provinces and territories. Ontario&#160;Aboriginal Affairs Minister David Zimmer also attended the UN meeting.</p>
                                            <p>“It can’t be done unilaterally,” said B.C. Grand Chief Edward John, who was also present for Tuesday’s announcement.</p>
                                            <p>John said that by adopting the UN declaration, more than ever Canada must now consult with Indigenous Peoples on any laws or administrative measures that affect them.</p>
                                            <p>“Indigenous governments are not some inferior form of authority,” John said. “They are the original form of authority over their lands, resources and territories.”</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Historic day</p>
                                            <p>Shortly after the 2015 federal election, Bennett pledged that the new Liberal government would implement the UN declaration as part of its effort to rebuild its working relationships with First Nations,&#160;Métis&#160;and Inuit peoples.</p>
                                            <p>Canada actually officially endorsed the declaration in 2010, but the Conservative government of the day called it an “aspirational document” and not legally binding.</p>
                                            <p>Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde&#160;— who will also be attending the Forum later&#160;this week —&#160;tweeted that it was a “historic day” as&#160;Canada&#160;moves toward reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.</p>

                        <p>Social work, as a helping profession, is especially concerned with the problems and rights of the disadvantaged, not only at home but also abroad. International social workers can be found undertaking a wide range of activities in a variety of national, international, and humanitarian organizations. These organizations include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">intergovernmental organizations,</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item" ">non-governmental organizations,</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">religious groups and other humanitarian organizations, and</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">community organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within these arenas, social workers participate as analysts and as direct practitioners in delivering and monitoring the assistance and protection provided by UN declarations and conventions. Social workers also frequently work in a front-line capacity, providing refugee settlement services, counselling children traumatized by war, distributing humanitarian assistance during disasters or war, and monitoring human rights abuses.</p>

<p>In Kosovo in the 1990s, for example, UNICEF provided life-saving assistance to children and women, and social workers were involved in distributing hygiene kits, blankets, water purification tablets, and basic medical supplies. They were also a part of trauma teams, along with medical professionals and psychologists, and participated in the long-term relief plans that emphasized support for educational systems and community organizations.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The United Nations, Religious Groups, and Other Humanitarian Organizations</p>

<p>Many social workers are active in various <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-8">international intergovernmental organizations (IGOs),</span> of which the United Nations is the best known. Formed at the end of World War II, the UN seeks to develop a framework of international law that will be followed by all nation states around the world. Social workers are employed in a variety of roles in its 12 specialized agencies, which include the UN Development Programme, UNICEF, World Health Organization, International Labour Office, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>

<p>Social workers also work for a multitude of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-9">non-governmental organizations (NGOs)</span> around the world. NGOs are international organizations, but they are not directly linked to governments. This allows such organizations more freedom to take up important issues and bring about effective change.</p>

<p>NGOs tend to be small, dynamic groups that work on a variety of issues related to their particular political or philosophical stances. Social workers working with NGOs frequently find themselves participating in peace building and conflict resolution. For example, in the central Caucasus region&mdash;Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan&mdash;social workers are using art therapy to help children heal from the trauma of war and to build peace between the various groups torn by inter-ethnic conflict since the late 1980s. The projects encourage the children to express their thoughts and feelings through coloured pictures and paintings. Children from all ethnic groups attend the projects, and it is hoped that links will be established between communities.</p>

<p>Religious groups and organizations have an extensive variety of overseas humanitarian programs, and they frequently employ the services of social workers. These groups tend to operate in the poorer countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey "><a href="# " id="page-451 " class="ch-link ">Training Opportunities for International Social Workers</a></p>

<p>Many NGOs have entry-level positions for new social workers without extensive hands-on experience. It is a great training ground. Students of social work may find it helpful to do volunteer work for NGOs to build experience and make contacts for future work. Non-governmental organizations such as Canadian Crossroads International, Canada World Youth, and World University Service of Canada provide excellent opportunities for social workers to gain international experience.</p>

<p>Increasingly, Canadian NGOs are not deploying social workers or any other staff to work directly in their overseas projects. Instead, they hire local people to implement their programs, people who already live in the country and who are thus familiar with the culture. More and more, Canadian social workers are employed at headquarters in Canada, providing assistance for international causes by planning projects, creating budgets and financial reports, and reporting and communicating with funders and local fieldworkers. This trend is illustrated by the work of Samantha McGavin (profiled at the end of this chapter) at Inter Pares. NGOs mobilize financial resources, materials, and volunteers to implement localized programs in other countries. They hold fundraising events and apply to governments and foundations for grants or contracts to raise money for their projects. NGOs vary tremendously in their methods. Some act principally as lobbyists, while others primarily implement programs. For example, an NGO such as Oxfam, concerned with poverty alleviation, might provide people with the equipment and skills to cultivate food, whereas an NGO like Human Rights Watch helps through investigation and documentation of human rights violations.</p>

<p>It is no longer the norm for religious groups to use their international programs primarily as a way to acquire new members. Today, for example, the United Church provides excellent local training programs for social workers worldwide but does not send workers abroad unless requested by partner organizations.</p>

<p>In addition to churches and other religious organizations, there are large international grant foundations that employ social workers as consultants, field representatives, and national program directors for initiatives supported by the foundation. The Canadian government also maintains offices in many countries to provide services to visiting Canadians and local people. These services frequently involve social workers. Other federal government departments, such as the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), hire social workers to help with their work.</p>

<p>Until March of 2013, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was an organization that administered foreign aid programs in developing countries, and operated in partnership with other Canadian and international organizations. CIDA was formed in 1968 by the Canadian government under Pierre Trudeau. In March of 2013, the Conservative government announced that CIDA would be folded into the Department of Foreign Affairs and would cease to exist as an independent entity.</p>

<p>Working directly for government agencies of other countries is another option for social workers seeking international experience. These agencies are not necessarily international in focus, but certainly can be considered as part of an international social work career. Generally, however, one must have extensive language skills and direct contacts within the country in order to obtain such a position.</p>

<p>Working in another country obviously involves fulfilling a role as a practitioner in another cultural context. How does one prepare for such work? How do social workers ensure that they are &ldquo;culturally competent&rdquo;?</p>

<p>In social work literature, the term <span class="span--keyword text--red " id="kc-10 ">cultural competence</span> emphasizes the need for social workers to gain an understanding of the world views and cultural frames of reference of their clients. Thus, workers must make an effort to understand the history, language, religions, and values of the cultural groups with which they are working. At the same time, practitioners working abroad need to be careful to avoid attributing stereotypes to communities and members of any given culture. A sound understanding of cultural contexts will help international social workers to be more effective in bringing about positive change.</p>

<p>For example, it would be inappropriate to work in China without considering the cultural differences among the various ethnic groups within the Chinese population. In addition, social workers must take their knowledge of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; culture and combine it with an analysis of how their own cultural outlook may influence their interventions. In other words, social workers need deep respect for the unique social conditions and cultural contexts within which they are working. Without such an appreciation of cultural differences, they will be less effective in assessing the problems at hand.</p>

<p>Cultural competence is clearly important for those social workers actively engaged in other countries. As Canada continues to evolve as a modern, ethnically diverse nation, cultural competence is an increasingly necessary skill set in our work, home, and community lives. Cherishing diversity is at the core of who we are as Canadians, and it is a value enshrined in our laws concerning multiculturalism. The Child Welfare League of America regards cultural competence as</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;the ability of individuals and systems to respond respectfully and effectively to people of all cultures, classes, races, ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and faiths and religions, in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families and communities, and protects and preserves the dignity of each.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Social service organizations of all types have much to gain by providing services in ways that are respectful of those groups, as well as being accommodating to their diverse characteristics and needs. Being culturally competent enables service providers to offer equitable, person-centred care. It is the most effective way to ensure that clients&rsquo; needs are being met and that clients are being provided with the best possible support.</p>

<p>Research has established that social and economic barriers&shy;&mdash;such as poverty, social exclusion, job insecurity, and lack of education&mdash;are equally or more important to a person&rsquo;s health than medical care or personal behaviours. These factors, known as social determinants of health, have a significant impact on one&rsquo;s well-being. Marginalized groups such as immigrants, Aboriginal people, and single-parent families experience a significant number of these barriers. Cultural competence&mdash;relating to people in these groups where they are and on their own terms&mdash;is an important part of the social work skill set and will allow social work practitioners to assist people in distress. Figure 14.3 shows six dimensions of cultural competence that play a role in international and cross-cultural social work practice.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey "><a href="# " id="page-453 " class="ch-link ">Developing Global Capability Inside the Social Work Profession</a></p>

<p>In a world that is increasingly interdependent, the need for cross-border collaboration has required the introduction of new values and global capability in the social work profession. International social work practice is characterized by several guiding values and culturally sensitive practice assumptions:</p>

<ul class="ul--list ">
    <li class="li--bullet-item ">Social, political, and economic events in any region of the world have direct effects&shy;&mdash;often immediate, and sometimes lasting&shy;&mdash;on the quality of life and human rights in other regions.</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">The human degradation and social injustice found in local communities often emanate from social, political, and economic forces that are international in character.</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">International social forces contribute to and sustain social inequalities in particular locales (e.g., global poverty and discrimination on the basis of race, class, and gender).</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">Only under conditions of peaceful coexistence can local, national, and international social development&mdash;and, in turn, human development&mdash;be accelerated.</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">The need to restructure the national and international social orders is important in reducing the levels of misery, degradation, and violence in many countries and regions of the world.</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">International social workers possess a unique body of knowledge and skills that can positively affect national and international causes, especially in helping to find sustainable solutions to recurrent social problems.</li>

    <li class="li--bullet-item ">Substantial numbers of international social work specialists, acting both individually and collectively, are continuing the national and international social movements begun by their predecessors, movements aimed at establishing a more peaceful and socially just world order (Estes, 2010).</li>

					<p class="text--bold text--bold-red ">Modelling effective international social work practice in the era of globalization</p>

					<p>Within international social work, four broad approaches or models can be identified. They are, of course, “abstractions.” They overlap and intesect and are not mutually exclusive.</p>

					<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Social Welfare Model</p>

					<p>The conventional model of international social work is largely based on the ideas of British economist John Maynard Keynes and, in particular, on American economist W.W. Rostow’s “stages of industrialization” theory. Rostow (1960) postulates that all societies go through five stages on the road to becoming a developed country: (1) traditional society, (2)&#160;preconditions for growth, (3) short period of intensive growth (“take-off”), (4) drive to maturity, and (5) era of mass consumption.</p>

					<p>Using this approach, the primary goal is to create the preconditions that will move a country through these stages of development. The immediate concern of social workers is with the satisfaction of basic social and material needs of people (e.g., standard of living and access to basic health care, education, and other essential social services). Once these are addressed, the society can move through the various stages toward full economic and social development.</p>

					<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The New World Order Model</p>

					<p>The new world order model, by contrast, is more radical. It has its origins in the idea that the world order is not a democratic one at all, but rather is one controlled by a relatively small number of wealthy countries and powerful corporations.</p>

					<p>Followers of this approach are concerned with bringing about sweeping changes in the institutional arrangements and relationships between and within nations, between the well-to-do and the less well-to-do. The focus is not only on inequality but on social participation,>The new world order model focuses on</p>

					<ul class="ul--list ">
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">the active participation of all relevant sectors in the transformation process,</li>
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">world peace and the prevention of war,</li>
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">the alleviation of human suffering,</li>
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">the creation of effective systems of social protection and social service provision,</li>
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">increased social and political justice, and</li>
						<li class="li--bullet-item ">the protection of the natural environment.</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey "><a href="#" id="page-455" class="ch-link">The Social Development Model</a></p>

					<p>A third approach, known loosely as the social development model, falls somewhere between the first two approaches. The social development model has its roots in the community development field.</p>

					<p>Less radical, perhaps, but no less committed, social workers who favour this approach focus on the immediate causes of human degradation, powerlessness, and social inequality, and seek to guide collective action toward the elimination of all forms of oppression, injustice, and violence. They are concerned with fostering social, political, and economic systems that are more humane, inclusive, and participatory.</p>

					<p>An important corollary is that of “sustainable development”—that is, development that “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, the “Bruntland Commission,” 1987).</p>

					<p>The idea of development is not a new idea, of course—Indigenous cultures have emphasized the need for a holistic approach or harmony between the environment, society, and economy. What is new is the way in which the social development model is put forth as a systematic solution to problems related to international social and economic&#160;development.</p>

					<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Sustainable Social Progress Model</p>

					<p>Finally, there is an extension of the social development model—what the International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW) calls “sustainable social progress.”</p>

					<p>This approach to international social work goes beyond ecological and environmental concerns. Sustainable development (or sustainable social progress) involves three basic operating&#160;premises:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list ">
		<li class="li--bullet-item "><span class="text--bold ">Equity and justice for all. </span>Upholding the rights of the poor and disadvantaged, and the rights of future generations.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item "><span class="text--bold ">A long-term view. </span>The view that claims on the Earth’s resources have implications for future generations.</li>
		<li class="li--bullet-item "><span class="text--bold ">Structural understanding of the broader society.</span> Taking into account the many interconnections between individuals, communities, the economy, and the environment.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This approach challenges us to think beyond the here and now and to look at the wider implications of our actions.</p>

	<p>In essence, this approach is a call to action—a call to do things differently and to realize that our actions have ripple effects throughout our increasingly interdependent world.</p>

					<p>International community work is a common type of social work activity in developing countries. Social workers partner with communities by assisting with problem solving and by planning effective social services. They use community work to organize people to bring about major social change between nations, within nations, and between groups of people. They work with communities to achieve the fullest participation of all members in transforming various aspects of their lives.</p>

<p>Social workers engaged in international community work need to be sensitive to local cultures and history. We may feel that the internationalization of social work is ultimately for the good of all, but in doing so we may fail to consider its relevance and transferability to local contexts. At worst, international social work may be viewed as a form of neo-colonialism, imposing an ethnocentric world view on many of the most vulnerable members of a society. For international social workers, spending time talking to key stakeholders to seek understanding of local perspectives is critically important.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Transforming Communities through Collaboration and Mutual Learning</p>

<p>As Kevin&rsquo;s story demonstrates, sensitive collaboration and mutual learning have the potential to transform communities, and ensure that the social work practices developed are responsive to specific cultural contexts. In this case study, Kevin Barnes-Ceeney describes his year-long employment as a social work advisor for the international development organization Voluntary Service Overseas. Kevin was based in a medical centre in Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan. The notion of social work there had changed since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and Kevin&rsquo;s role was to develop and help advance the practice. As Kevin&rsquo;s story shows, the social work staff at the medical centre were struggling with the adoption of a completely new and different view of what a social worker does.</p>

<p>Community work is arguably more important today in the era of globalization. People living in localized communities are vulnerable to the large-scale social and political changes that occur within and between countries, changes over which they have little or no control. Social work practitioners can bring an understanding of the global context to those at the local level in order to mitigate potential disruption.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of community work is the empowerment or fostering of the &ldquo;sense in people that they have the ability and right to influence their environment&rdquo; (Lee, 1999: 43). Empowering people means that they can take action on their own behalf to meet their physical, spiritual, and psychological needs and participate directly in the process of social change.</p>

<p>To be able to act on their own behalf, however, people must see themselves as agents, with the right and ability to express their opinions and to acquire resources. Reaching these objectives requires a genuine sense of community among participants (Lee, 1999). On the basis of community, new organizations can be built or improved upon, and change can be effected.</p>

		                <p class="text--bold">The social work staff at a medical centre in Astana, Kazakhstan, asked a social work advisor for help in making the transition from a concept of social work as &ldquo;home help&rdquo; to a profession that values social justice and empowerment.</p>

<p>My arrival in Kazakhstan was the beginning of a rapid learning curve for me. Securing safe and reasonably priced accommodation with a limited budget was challenging. Temperatures that dipped to &ndash;43&deg; C exacerbated the day-to-day challenges of purchasing provisions with limited language skills. Finding an interpreter to work alongside me was difficult, as many of the applicants who responded to my advertisement had limited English language skills.</p>

<p>To understand the broader institutional landscape, I visited agencies across the city. Here, my identity as a foreigner helped me gain access to a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations. I toured the Center for Social Adaptation (an agency that works with homeless people); visited orphanages, schools, and drug rehabilitation centres; met with a variety of NGO staff working on issues ranging from domestic violence to children with physical disabilities; spoke with professors at the Eurasian National University; and liaised with workers based at UNICEF. I asked the agencies to describe the key social problems affecting the residents of Astana. They discussed drug use, homelessness, corruption, inequality, HIV and STIs, and the need for activities and youth-friendly services, accessibility, and women&rsquo;s empowerment.</p>

<p>During my time in Kazakhstan, I witnessed a steady flow of international &ldquo;experts&rdquo; flying in with lectures and workshops on social work and rehabilitation issues. The implementation of such &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; Western interventions raised many concerns. For example, a large drug rehabilitation centre had set aside a room where detoxifying clients could relive the trauma of their passage through their mother&rsquo;s birth canal.</p>

<p>I observed some &ldquo;imported&rdquo; therapies that did prove successful. Equine therapy, which can help physically disabled children develop muscle tone, balance, and coordination, was popular, seemingly fitting within a deep cultural history of reverence for horses and horsemanship in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Mindful that I did not want to be yet another international actor importing disconnected advice and expertise, I devoted time to shadowing social work staff in the medical centre, and I observed the variety of social work-related activities that occurred. These included a weekly group for young people who had engaged in solvent and inhalant misuse, and a daily handicrafts group for women with physical disabilities. In addition, a handful of drug-using clients attended appointments with the resident psychologist.</p>

<p>I spent time building a rapport with the social work staff team, sharing cultural perspectives, discussing what social work meant to them, and listening to why they had chosen this particular field of work. They disclosed that their wages were often insecure, and at times some were not paid for many months. Many revealed fears of working with clients who might be violent, drug addicted, or homeless.</p>

<p>The staff members were keen for me to provide &ldquo;trainings&rdquo; for them and for youth volunteers from a local university. Seeking to work in a collaborative fashion, I pushed staff to identify potential training topics. They told me they wanted to know what social work is and what social workers do. So I developed a weekly skills-based training program that focused on communication skills, empathy building, assessment and case planning skills, and individual and group supervision. The training consisted of role plays, small-group discussions, and individual presentations, with overarching weekly themes (e.g., drug and alcohol use, homelessness, sexual abuse). At the team&rsquo;s request, we also explored harm reduction strategies and safer injection techniques, and together we developed a child protection protocol for staff in the medical centre.</p>

<p>Looking back at my year-long placement, I realize I should have spent more time focusing on the intra-organizational relationships between the social work staff/volunteers and the medical centre staff. Improved relationships would have helped to fashion a more integrated and sustainable role for the emerging social workers.</p>

					<p>The situation of many of the world&rsquo;s people is perilous and precarious. For example, 6.3 million children under the age of five died in 2013 from preventable diseases, two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s illiterate people are women, and countless people continue to be killed or tortured by oppressive governments. Such statistics have been around for decades, and many experts believe they will worsen as poor countries are impacted by climate change.</p>

<p>Part of the hope for improvement lies in human rights instruments and their implementation, and in ever-growing international consciousness and solidarity. Social workers have a role in strengthening such solidarity and working to translate the principles enshrined in the human rights instruments into reality.</p>

<p>It is easy to apply a human rights critique to institutions &ldquo;out there,&rdquo; particularly those in another part of the world. But to truly be human rights advocates, social workers should use the same critical eye to monitor the language they use and the work they undertake on a daily basis. It is essential that social workers operate in ways that observe human rights principles within their own practices as well.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">Social Workers Can Help Make Human Rights Declarations a Reality</p>

<p>A key value toward this end is allowing people to maximize self-determination and control over the situations in which they find themselves. To truly reflect human rights principles, social work is practised in a manner that avoids stigmatizing, labelling, or controlling the lives of the people with whom we work. If social work practice truly encompasses the full range of values and ethics that inform the profession (which for the most part are identical to human rights principles), it is in a unique position to help make the vision espoused in various human rights declarations a reality.</p>

<p>Steve&rsquo;s story from the Philippines illustrates social work in action in protecting negative human rights, also known as first-generation rights. These are civil and political rights that ensure protection from torture, false imprisonment, or summary execution. As discussed previously in this chapter, social workers also address second-generation rights (economic, social, and cultural rights) and third-generation, or collective, rights. The profession&rsquo;s focus on human needs shapes its conviction that meeting these needs is not a matter of choice but an imperative of basic justice.</p>

<p>This transition from needs orientation to rights affirmation allows social workers to navigate different political systems to uphold and defend the rights of their clients and of society in general. As you may imagine, this can place social workers in a precarious role, as they are often employed by the state or agents of the state. Professional social workers are tasked with serving as reliable employees while at the same time serving clients as best they can. This often entails advocating for policy changes within the state agency that employs them. Viewing social work within a global human rights perspective provides a sense of unity and international solidarity without losing sight of the local context, conditions, and needs.</p>

		                <p class="text--bold">Human rights work isn&rsquo;t for everyone, but it is desperately needed. Combining direct practice, interviewing skills, and advocacy skills, social workers make invaluable contributions to human rights fact-finding teams.</p>

<p>I had worked briefly in Central America with World University Service Canada, and found the work to be rewarding and fast-paced. I applied to numerous organizations and was hired by the United Church of Canada (UCC) to work in the Philippines. The UCC was expanding its peace and justice work, and my interests fit perfectly. My spouse and I were both hired for a two-year term to assist Filipinos in documenting human rights violations.</p>

<p>Teams of 8 to 12 people, mostly comprised of Filipinos, trekked through the jungle to visit isolated communities that had experienced gross violations of human rights. We would collect affidavits documenting violations such as summary executions, mass killings, bombing, sexual assaults, and other atrocities. Our job was stated simply&mdash;to get the information and transfer it out of the community to the city.</p>

<p>Excellent social work interviewing skills were vital in this work. We would always begin with open-ended, inviting questions, and then listen carefully. People were sometimes hesitant to share their story for fear of reprisals. We were always careful to respect their rights and not try to push for a statement. I often used clarifying skills to probe for details about specific events. I would end the interview with a summary, in order to check the accuracy of my interpretation. I would also share information about how the statement would be used to let the world know what had happened in this community and how it might contribute to political change in the Philippines.</p>

<p>While my job was simply stated, it was not really that simple. When people share traumatic events with others, there is a kind of re-living of the trauma. It would have been unethical to request that someone share an event and not stay with that person to help them process their experience. Because our visits to the community were brief, long-term therapy was not an option.</p>

<p>Instead, I offered brief interventions to help people work through the difficult thoughts and feelings they were experiencing. In particular, we identified negative thoughts that might lead to depression and looked at alternative ways of coping. CBT showed clients how to challenge their thoughts, and MBT taught them how to simply acknowledge their thoughts and view them with compassion. I also taught anxiety management techniques, such as relaxation and mindfulness meditation.</p>

<p>The work did not end with the collection of information on human rights violations. As you can imagine, the government security forces did not want this information to leave the community and be made public, and they would often stop us, harass us, arrest us, or worse. This work required a high level of resiliency. We had to be careful that we did not burn out or experience vicarious trauma (VT) (also called compassion fatigue). We used various strategies to protect ourselves, including mental preparation before potentially stressful situations and self-care methods such as mindfulness and yoga.</p>

<p>As a team, we met to debrief after each assignment. We would discuss the meaning of our work that day and look at its positive aspects. If we noticed signs that a colleague might be experiencing VT, then we would take action, referring the person to counselling and removing them from work for a while. Typical signs of VT include emotional numbing, a desire for social isolation, nightmares, feelings of despair and hopelessness, and a lack of energy.</p>

<p>Next, we entered our information into a database and ensured that it reached the appropriate organizations outside the country, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. I used my networking and advocacy skills to ensure that the information reached the proper people. I followed up with each organization to ensure that the information met their advocacy needs, discuss how we could make it more applicable and useful, and answer any questions. Working as a team and communicating with our partner organizations improved our interviewing skills greatly, which helped to ensure that our data were complete and reliable.</p>

					<p>Conflicts in war zones can have dire effects on human rights. Fear of violence or persecution can spur inhabitants to flee, sometimes uprooting entire communities and leaving people traumatized and deprived of ways to meet their basic needs&mdash;food, water, shelter, and safety. The varied skill set that social workers develop equips them well for work in areas affected by war. This work often occurs in refugee camps or in areas to which large numbers of people have fled. Sometimes, the work occurs directly within areas of conflict and often involves providing help to women and children. As Steve&rsquo;s story from Kosovo shows, the work demands an array of activities and skills, including community organization; logistical support for the provision of water, food, sanitation, and health care; direct intervention to help people cope with trauma and sexual violence; advocacy; and peacemaking. Social workers often act as power brokers, using legal recourses and personal influence to secure resources and services that their clients cannot demand for themselves.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey ">The Benefits of a Community-Based Approach</p>

<p>When social workers are engaged in war zones and refugee camps, they must try to maintain open lines of communication with the various factions involved in the conflict. They must refrain from taking sides. To do their job safely, social workers may need to find creative ways to win acceptance by members of the community they are trying to help. Establishing trust involves deep listening, networking, and mediation, as illustrated by Steve&rsquo;s story. It is important to listen to the people whose lives have been upended and to avoid making assumptions about how they feel or what they need.</p>

<p>A community-based approach is often effective. Refugee camps are filled with people who possess abundant skills, and tapping into these skills has a two-fold benefit: it can instill a sense of empowerment and usefulness in a situation where people often feel helpless and isolated, and it expedites the work that needs to be done.</p>

<p>For example, as of the writing of this text, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is deploying social workers to provide support to Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. Hundreds of thousands of people displaced by conflicts inside Syria and Iraq will receive winter emergency kits, medical and emergency supplies, clean water, sanitation, and education. Targeted emotional and educational support for women and children will include counselling for survivors of sexual violence and help for children who have crossed the border to reunite with their families. Job training, work placements, and access to legal assistance will be made available. Whenever possible, the IRC employs a community-based approach.</p>

<p>Peacemaking, conflict resolution, and nonviolent communication are other examples of social work skills that can benefit people affected by war. The goal is to de-escalate, prevent, or stop conflicts. Social workers engage in processes such as education, negotiation, mediation, conciliation, and arbitration, sometimes drawing upon international law. The objective is to move toward nonviolent dialogue, where differences can be settled without violent outcomes.</p>

			            </div>
			        
			        
		            <div class="grid--full cf ">
		                <p class="text--bold">Steve discovered that sustaining a collective effort in a war-torn region required a constant focus on the values of self-determination, empowerment, and social justice.</p>

<p>Having just co-founded a new organization tasked with helping children in war zones, I travelled to Kosovo after armed conflict began there in 1998. I ended up in Kukus, Albania, where approximately 150,000 Kosovars had fled to escape the war. Our organization&rsquo;s mission was to respond quickly to the immediate needs of these displaced people in a community-based manner that also emphasized self-determination and self-empowerment.</p>

<p>I arrived with no preconception of what such a response would look like. As I met with other social workers and relief workers, I learned that no one really knew what the people in the refugee camps needed or desired. Workers were basing their responses on their organization&rsquo;s specialized expertise. For example, organizations that specialized in trauma treatment proposed offering trauma treatment. However, responses that are informed by the people affected by traumatic events are more consistent with a community-based perspective, so I went to the camps to speak directly with different groups of people to determine their needs from their perspective.</p>

<p>Collective Efforts that Empower People</p>

<p>It quickly became clear that the primary need was adequate food. The camps were new, and relief supplies were slow to arrive and unsuited to the nutritional needs of the occupants. Over and over, people said that what they wanted most was a simple loaf of fresh bread&mdash;the staple food for Kosovars. Instead, they often ate fruit cups and canned herring. I can attest that this is not a tasty combination.</p>

<p>The lack of bread posed a huge challenge. First, getting fresh bread to a remote area of Albania to feed 150,000 people seemed impossible. The bakery in Kukus could only produce 100 loaves of bread a day&mdash;enough to feed the existing local population of 1000. Additionally, I knew nothing about baking bread and had no idea where to start. I recognized my limitations and began to seek help.</p>

<p>I began by talking to citizens, relief workers, and displaced people themselves. I connected with representatives of the World Food Programme, who said they would guarantee a supply of ingredients if I could build a bakery. I came across a British army officer who said, &ldquo;We have an eight-oven field bakery used to supply bread to troops in the field that you can have; you just have to transport it yourself.&rdquo; More networking led me to a United States Air Force officer who agreed to supply the aircraft to pick up the field bakery and deliver it to Kukus. I was ecstatic.</p>

<p>Back at the camps, I asked for volunteers and immediately had a line-up 300 meters long. The president of the largest bakery in Pristina, the largest city in Kosovo, learned that many of his staff in the camps were eager to help. I found an engineering professor who volunteered to set up a generator and keep it running, and the head of Public Health volunteered to ensure that health concerns were addressed. After about four days, we had a fully staffed bakery&mdash;with perhaps the most qualified staff of any bakery in the world.</p>

<p>The bakery was operational within five days, producing upwards of 26,000 loaves of bread per day. Other relief agencies helped with distribution.</p>

<p>Not everything proceeded smoothly, however. Some groups of Kosovars rallied to question why they had been left out of the process. The answer was that it would have been impossible to involve all 150,000 people. So, an advisory committee was established to represent the various groups within the camps. Establishing, organizing, and facilitating this committee required sharp analytical and interpersonal skills, as well as political astuteness.</p>

<p>When a volunteer asked me how a social worker had managed to start up a bakery, I replied, &ldquo;I saw my job as listening to people, maximizing their power and participation, and applying my skills in communication, community organizing, and networking.&rdquo; He smiled and responded, &ldquo;Well, I think only a social worker could have made this happen.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Samantha McGavin, a commmunications director with Inter Pares, an international social justice organization, believes that true social transformation begins with people working for change in their own communities and societies.</p>

<p>Had someone suggested social work to me as a career during my high-school or early undergraduate years, when I was interested in the helping professions, I would have become a clinical social worker. But my youthful interest in environmentalism led me first to a canvassing job with Greenpeace after high school, and then to the Qu&eacute;bec Public Interest Research Group (QPIRG) at McGill University. Those two experiences were the start of a lifelong education and vocation inspired by activism and social issues.</p>

<p>After a year&rsquo;s involvement in mostly unpaid activism following the attainment of my B.A., I enrolled in McGill&rsquo;s post-graduate B.S.W. program in 1999. During this 16-month program, I immersed myself in learning about approaches to community development, Canadian social policy, and models of social change. My practicum with a local anti-poverty organization in an immigrant-rich, low-income neighbourhood familiarized me with social programs and community resources, and enhanced my previous experiences of working with others to raise awareness about injustice and avenues for change.</p>

<p>Inter Pares hired me in 2002 as a fundraiser&mdash;and I began an intense education in fundraising, communications, and event organizing, as well as consensus-building and non-profit management. I also gained more knowledge about social movements and the political histories of countries around the world. It took me a year or two to feel like I was truly familiar with our fundraising program, institutional structures, and management culture, and to fully participate in the political conversations about our programs. It took some time for me to be equally confident in my knowledge, opinions, and leadership.</p>

<p>Today, we work in nearly 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, partnering with national-level organizations that are engaging in advocacy, social movement building, and support for grassroots community organizations. Our interests of common concern are broad&mdash;women&rsquo;s equality, peace and democracy, economic justice, food sovereignty, health, migrants&rsquo; and refugees&rsquo; rights, and control over resources such as minerals and water&mdash;but we are all joined by our values and belief in building change from the ground up.</p>

<p>Because we feel that it is important to serve as political actors in our own context, we also advocate for improved Canadian foreign policy, we support domestic social change efforts, and we play a bridging role in bringing together Canadian and international activists.</p>

<p>I have the opportunity to meet and build relationships with overseas colleagues when we bring them to Canada, by arranging radio and newspaper interviews and by organizing meetings with local activists who share similar concerns and struggles.</p>

<p>For instance, in 2012, we invited a Sudanese women&rsquo;s rights activist to speak at our annual public Speaker Series event, which I co-organized and moderated. Along with a colleague in our Africa program, I organized her visit and set up meetings for her with the local Sudanese diaspora, Muslim and youth activists, and community activists and legal experts in the area of violence against women. We discussed young people&rsquo;s leadership, mobilization in Islamic contexts, and working with women experiencing violence and oppressive laws.</p>

<p>My own role is focused on sharing stories of social change to help inspire and engage people to take action&mdash;whether through donating money, learning about issues, educating others about an issue, participating in a campaign, or creating change in their own lives and communities.</p>

<p>I make sure to complement my role with participation in community-building in my own city and neighbourhood. I now have two young children and am not as active outside of work as I was ten or fifteen years ago. However, I still feel that it is important for me to be politically engaged in my own name as well as Inter Pares&rsquo; name. It is important for children to see their parents&rsquo; involvement in social and political causes, so that as they grow and learn about social issues, they can also learn about avenues for social change.</p>
