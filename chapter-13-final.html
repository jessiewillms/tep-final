        <p class="text--caption">In recent years, the definition of “disability” has shifted from “something that is wrong” with an individual to reflect a more inclusive view that links an individual with impairments to broader social, political, cultural, and environmental characteristics.</p>
        <p class="text--caption">According to the United Nations, “Disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments, conditions, or illnesses and the environmental and attitudinal barriers they face. Such impairments, conditions, or illnesses may be permanent, temporary, intermittent, or imputed, and include those that are physical, sensory, psychosocial, neurological, medical, or intellectual.”</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-408" class="ch-link"></a>The distinction between <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">persons with disabilities</span> and those without dates back to the English Poor Law of 1601, which divided those seeking charitable support into the &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; poor and the &ldquo;non-deserving&rdquo; poor. Determining who was part of the deserving poor was based on the inability to work, or to serve one&rsquo;s master or landowner. The deserving poor were entitled to charitable support, such as permission to beg or to receive charity from religious institutions. These forms of charitable relief, known as &ldquo;outdoor relief,&rdquo; were eventually brought from the old world to the new, including Canada. Other forms of outdoor relief included being lodged with a family or individual, in which case the homeowner would be given a small stipend.</p>

<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, outdoor relief had come to be seen as a mechanism that created rather than relieved dependency. Outdoor or community-based relief was gradually replaced with institutional care&mdash;asylums, work houses, poor houses, special schools, chronic care facilities, and later, hospitals (Splane, 1965). This new form of relief became known as &ldquo;indoor relief.&rdquo; By the end of the nineteenth century, most of the charitable relief for individuals with disabilities in Canada had shifted to institution-based programs.</p>

<p>Each province developed its own relief programs for persons with disabilities, as well as special schools and institutions. As a result, no national support programs were established. Indeed, no significant national support care programs for persons with disabilities exist in Canada to the present day (Hanes and Moscovitch, 2002).</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Institutionalization of People with Disabilities</p>

<p>The replacement of outdoor relief with indoor relief represented a significant shift in the philosophy regarding charitable help. Persons with disabilities, who had previously been considered part of the social order, were now viewed as a nuisance population to be removed from society, isolated, and placed in segregated institutions. Disability was considered a source of shame, and many persons with disabilities who were not sent to institutions were hidden away in their homes by their family members. There are numerous examples of people with various forms of disabilities being hidden or kept at home in Canada, the U.S., and the U.K. throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Hanes, 1995). The public disdain toward individuals with disabilities became so severe that some municipalities, such as York (now known as Toronto), developed bylaws that banned people with disabilities from public streets.</p>

<p>As time progressed, more and more institutions for housing various disabled populations were constructed, and by the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of individuals had been placed in these institutions. Many of these facilities remained in operation until the mid-1990s and early 2000s. By the mid-twentieth century, many provinces had &ldquo;special&rdquo; residential schools for children and adolescents who were blind and/or deaf. Provincial institutions had been also established for people with psychiatric disabilities, and many provinces had institutions for people with developmental disabilities. Specialized hospitals were established for many disabled populations, including tuberculosis hospitals, orthopaedic hospitals, and rehabilitation&#160;hospitals.</p>

<p>The institutionalization of people with disabilities became so widespread that it was commonly believed to be the natural order of things, and that people with disabilities had always been separated from their communities (Bowe, 1978).</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Post-War Period and Beyond</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-409" class="ch-link"></a>Following World War II, Canada witnessed the gradual expansion of the &ldquo;welfare state,&rdquo; and many new social security programs, such as pensions and disability benefits, were put in place. There emerged the notion of the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">multidisciplinary rehabilitation team,</span> which included physicians, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and later, social workers, psychologists, and vocational counsellors. The field itself eventually fell under the domain of the medical profession, which became responsible for determining whether there was a need for specialized care, income supports, pensions, educational supports, transportation supports, home care supports, and other benefits.</p>

<p>Medical and social services for people with disabilities have significantly expanded since this period. They include special schools, training programs, sheltered workshops, summer camps, recreational programs, special hospitals, and after-care facilities, as well as special trades and industries. Rehabilitation services of this type are still a primary area of social work with persons with disabilities. Social workers are also employed by provincial and federal governments and by charitable organizations, both in the provision of services and in the development of policies.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, there has been a shift away from a strict, medical approach to a more &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; model in which persons with disabilities are accepted fully as equal citizens. The Independent Living Movement (ILM) has been been at the forefront of this new approach. The ILM philosophy promotes self-direction, self-determination, and full participation in the life of one&rsquo;s community and has single-handedly begun a new era for persons with disabilities.</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-410" class="ch-link"></a>Until 2010, Statistics Canada used census data to carry out detailed research into disability. The <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-3">Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS)</span> population consisted of all persons who answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to either of the census questions on activity limitations. The federal government discontinued the long-form census in 2010, however, and PALS was discontinued.</p>

<p>The most recent data on disability come from the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">Canadian Survey on Disability 2012 (CSD),</span> although many believe that this survey was not as comprehensive as PALS. The CSD examined only individuals with disabilities who were of working age (15 and older) living in private dwellings. As a result, there is limited information about the needs of children or of people residing in chronic-care facilities or nursing homes. There are also minimal data pertaining to First Nations, as the research did not apply to First Nations persons living on reserves.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, the CSD reports that in 2012, an estimated 3.8 million adults were limited in their daily activities due to a disability (13.7 percent of the total Canadian population). The three most prevalent disability types are pain, mobility, or flexibility (see Figure 13.1). Of those Canadians who reported at least one of these types of disability, more than 40 percent experienced all three at the same time.</p>

<p>In 2012, 26 percent of persons with disabilities had impairments that were classified as very severe; 23 percent had severe disabilities; 20 percent had moderate disabilities; and 32 percent had mild disabilities. Additionally, 81.3 percent reported using some kind of assistive device&mdash;for example, to facilitate movement (e.g., wheelchairs, hand and arm supports) or to help them hear, see, or learn (e.g., hearing aids, magnifiers, specialized computers).</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Disability and the Age of Canadians</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-411" class="ch-link"></a>Not surprisingly, the prevalence of disability among Canadians increases with age. In&#8239;2012, 2.3&#8239;million working-age Canadians (aged 15 to 64), or 10.1 percent of the total population, reported having a disability. Among Canadians 65 or older, however, 33.2 percent reported a disability. Of the working-age population, 4.4 percent reporting a disability were aged 15 to 24, 6.5 percent were 25 to 44, and 16.1 percent were 45 to 64. The proportion who reported a disability rose to 26.3 percent for those aged 65 to 74, and 42.5 percent for those 75 and older.</p>

In 2011, however, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC) decided that the PALS would be cancelled and that, in its place, a new data strategy on disability would be launched.</p>

<p>The most prevalent types of disability also vary according to age. In the youngest age group (15 to 24), the most commonly reported types of disability were mental or psychological (2.2&#8239;percent); learning related (2.0 percent); and pain (1.9 percent). Among those aged 45 to 64, the most common impairments were pain (12.7 percent), flexibility (9.8 percent), and mobility (8.6 percent). While these three types of disabilities were also the most commonly reported among seniors, the prevalence was much higher: 22.1 percent for pain, 20.5 percent for mobility, and 19.3 percent for flexibility. Perhaps not surprisingly, the prevalence of hearing-related disabilities was also high among seniors (10.4 percent).</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 13.2, Canadian women have a higher prevalence of disability in almost all age groups. The proportion of those reporting a disability among adult women was 14.9 percent, and only 12.5 percent for men. Among the oldest Canadians (those aged 75 or above), 44.5 percent of women reported a disability, compared to 39.8 percent of men. In the 15-to-24 age group, the proportion of men an d women reporting a disability was similar in 2012: 4.5&#8239;percent for men and 4.3 percent for women.</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-412" class="ch-link"></a>The American Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 represented a pivotal point in the history of persons with disabilities in the United States, as well as in Canada. This legislation prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities, stating the following:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States as defined by Section 7 shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance (Zola, 1986: 1).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spurred on by the successes of the U.S. movement, Canadians with disabilities began to advocate under their own national umbrella, the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (which later became known as the Council of Canadians with Disabilities). Notable Canadian leaders such as Henry Enns, Allan Simpson, and Jim Doerksen united people around the Canadian Independent Living Movement. They were also at the forefront of the movement to have disability rights included in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With the passage of the Charter in 1982, Canada became one of the first countries in the world to have the rights of people with disabilities guaranteed under law.</p>

<p>Currently, two broad approaches characterize discussions of disability and social work involvement with persons with disabilities:</p>

	<ul class="ul--list">
		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Medical model.</span> The medical model has its roots in rehabilitation medicine, where the focus of the intervention is on the individual. It views disability as an &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; and a &ldquo;personal tragedy&rdquo; and emphasizes the need of the individual to adapt or otherwise fit within mainstream society as much as possible.</p>

		<li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold span--keyword text--red" id="kc-6">Political rights model.</span> The political rights model, on the other hand, is concerned with the broader social and political context and with the need for society as a whole to adapt to the needs of persons who have disabilities.</li>
	</ul>


<p>The pre-eminent British disability advocate and theorist Michael Oliver coined the terms &ldquo;personal tragedy theory&rdquo; and &ldquo;social oppression theory&rdquo; to describe the differences between these two approaches to disability (Oliver, 1990).</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Medical Model</p>

<p>From the perspective of the medical model (or the &ldquo;personal tragedy theory&rdquo;), a disabling condition is an unfortunate life event calling for some form of professional and medical assistance (Oliver, 1990). Disability is seen primarily as a medical and rehabilitative problem. The various forms of professional rehabilitative and medical interventions are means of &ldquo;curing&rdquo; or &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; the individual. According to this theory, persons who become disabled, as well as their loved ones, must go through various stages of psychological and emotional adjustment before they can accept themselves or their loved one as a person with a disability.</p>

<p>Much of the literature pertaining to the impact of disability is based on this &ldquo;stages of adjustment&rdquo; approach (i.e., feeling anger, denial, and depression before accepting disability as part of one&rsquo;s life). However, this approach has been critiqued by many researchers on the grounds that, for most people, disability is not a tragedy, a &ldquo;life sentence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a fate worse than death.&rdquo; Indeed, many disability activists and social workers contend that the day-to-day difficulties faced by people with disabilities are not the result of their limitations so much as the social and attitudinal barriers they encounter.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Political Rights Model</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-413" class="ch-link"></a>In contrast to the medical model of disability, the political rights model (also referred to as the &ldquo;independent living model&rdquo;) holds that the problems faced by people with disabilities are not the result of physical impairments alone, but are also the result of the social and political inequalities that exist between people with disabilities and those without (Oliver, 1990). This alternative model challenges the widely prevalent view that disability is essentially a rehabilitation problem requiring individual treatment and individual solutions. It also calls for a different focus for interventions on behalf of persons with&#160;disabilities.</p>

<p>This approach views people with disabilities as members of a minority population. &ldquo;Many persons with disabilities,&rdquo; Lex Frieden suggests, &ldquo;consider themselves as members of a minority group related not by colour or nationality but by functional limitation and similar need&rdquo; (Frieden, 1983: 55). Environmental factors&mdash;such as a lack of employment opportunities, lack of affordable housing, and lack of accessible transportation, as well as the presence of negative stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes&mdash;are a major source of the problem. Structural and attitudinal changes, both social and political, are required if these obstacles are to be overcome.</p>

<p>According to the political rights model of disability, medical interventions alone are not enough. This approach calls for the incorporation of a full human-rights focus. Medical interventions are important, to be sure, but social, political, and legislative changes are required at the national, provincial, and community levels if the needs and concerns of people with disabilities are to be properly addressed.</p>

        <p class="text--caption">Since the early 1980s, the terms “person with disabilities” and “people with disabilities” came to be accepted as the most appropriate terms to be used when referring to individuals who have disabilities. In more recent times, however, more and more people with disabilities, especially those who promote disability culture, are using the term “disabled person” to self-identify.</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-414" class="ch-link"></a>Many students of social work are familiar the terms &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; &ldquo;sexism,&rdquo; &ldquo;heterosexism,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ageism,&rdquo; but they may be less familiar with the term &ldquo;ableism.&rdquo; This term refers to the stigmatization of disability and the existence of prejudicial attitudes held by people without disabilities toward people with disabilities. <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">Ableism</span> is a belief in the superiority of people without disabilities over people with disabilities. It can take the form of ideas and assumptions, stereotypes, practices, physical barriers in the environment, and larger-scale (systemic) oppression.</p>

<p>There is nothing inherent in disability that should lead to the stigmatization of people with disabilities or lead to the development of belief systems wherein biological difference is linked to biological inferiority. Yet in most Western industrialized societies, there has been a growing cultural emphasis on the &ldquo;body beautiful.&rdquo; Physical attractiveness, sexuality, and desirability have become a valued cultural norm. People with disabilities often do not meet cultural standards of physical attractiveness, and this contributes to the stigma attached to disability, according to which having a disability is to be undesirable and unlovable. For persons with disabilities, this attitude has implications for many aspects of life, such as developing friendships and intimate relationships, socializing, and being involved in recreational activities.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Stereotypes Abound</p>

<p>As with all forms of discrimination, stereotypes abound concerning people with disabilities. For example, there is a common belief that people with disabilities are in a continuous state of emotional distress and psychological suffering. This stems from the long-held belief that if there is damage to one aspect of the system (physical disability), then there would be damage to the emotional and mental aspects as well. Yet, this is clearly not the case: most persons with disabilities cope well and have no negative emotional or mental side effects.</p>

<p>Sometimes a person with a disability is seen as deserving of the disability. For example, a young person who becomes disabled as a result of driving while intoxicated may be viewed as having received what he or she deserved. As well, there is often very little sympathy for adults who have disabling conditions as a consequence of a particular lifestyle&mdash;for example, because of drug use, prostitution, or unprotected sex. Some people still believe, too, that a disability is the consequence of sinful activities on the part of an individual or parent. Congenital disorders, for example, are often attributed to the risky behaviours of mothers during pregnancy, even though there is no scientific support for such claims. There are many examples in folklore, literature, TV programs, and films that portray persons with disabilities as being evil. Disability may even remind people of their own mortality. Indeed, much of the literature pertaining to the psychological adjustment to the onset of disability comes from the study of death and dying. Such stereotypes and fears may lead to the avoidance of people with disabilities, further contributing to their social isolation.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of sexism or racism, stereotyping and stigmatization abound in the case of persons with disabilities, though such negative portrayals are seldom acknowledged, let alone discussed publicly. For example, terms such as &ldquo;defective,&rdquo; &ldquo;crippled,&rdquo; or &ldquo;lame&rdquo; are now generally considered to be derogatory and inappropriate, but they are still used in everyday conversation. (For more respectful and appropriate terminology for referring to persons with disabilities, see Table 13.2.) Much progress has been made, but persons with disabilities are often still not treated as equal to able-bodied persons.</p>

                    <p>The social work profession has a long history of advocating for the rights of people with disabilities, including citizenship rights. Partly as a result of this advocacy work, social workers have witnessed the implementation of legislation at the provincial/territorial and federal levels that guarantees the rights of people with disabilities. For the most part, this anti-discriminatory legislation is rooted in the human rights acts of the provincial/territorial and federal governments. Canada is one of the few countries in the world with a constitution guaranteeing the rights of people with disabilities.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Work and Rights for People with Disabilities</p>

                    <p>While people with disabilities benefit by having their individual rights and freedoms protected through human rights codes and legislation, whether it is at the provincial/territorial or federal level, such legislation is said to be more reactive than proactive.</p>

                    <p>For example, a disabled individual who feels that his or her rights have been or are being violated can take their case to the human rights commission of their province or territory. If the issue involves the federal government, then the individual can go to the Canada Human Rights Commission. These commissions will investigate the claim and make decisions that may or may not be in favour of the individual. This reactive process can take years to resolve.</p>

                    <p>As Prince (2010) points out, however, much of the discussion pertaining to a Canadians with Disabilities Act (CDA) favours a proactive approach. Proactive, disability-positive legislation could establish principles that allow for greater opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>

                    <p>At the heart of a proactive CDA would be opportunities for public awareness, greater potential for barrier removal, and greater access to such items as education, employment, and community supports. As well, a CDA would have to provide a framework for “timelines for implementation and compliance, and enforcement” (Prince, 2010: 200–202).</p>

                    <p>The government of Canada is consulting with disability rights organizations across the country, seeking advice with regard to the development of a comprehensive, progressive, and inclusive Canadians with Disabilities Act.</p>

                    <p>Although many disability rights activists have advocated for a Canadians with Disabilities Act, many are still not in favour of such legislation. The following provides an overview of both sides of this debate. The material comes from Lana Kerzner and David Baker’s “A Canadians with Disabilities Act?” (May, 1999) and is provided by the Council of Canadians with Disabilities.</p>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">At the present time, Canada does not have a nationwide Canadians with Disabilities Act, and it is now time for a comprehensive piece of legislation in this area.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">A comprehensive Canadians with Disabilities Act would offer greater opportunities for public awareness regarding the needs and concerns of people with disabilities throughout Canada.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">The rights of Canadians with disabilities are guaranteed under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and provincial and territorial human rights codes, so no additional legislation is needed.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Some of the factors that have contributed to the ineffectiveness of the current laws would not be resolved with the enactment of a CDA. All that would result would be yet another piece of legislation with a lot of potential but that still produces insufficient results.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Specific legislation aimed at ensuring rights for people with disabilities may lead to other disenfranchised groups (such as LGBTQ+ persons, people of colour, First Nations persons, and others) demanding similar legislation. The concern is that there may be a backlash and that a proposed CDA might only get limited support from other groups.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Federal legislators might view the disability-specific legislation as being precedent-setting, which could potentially lead to other groups, such as those noted above, to demand similar legislation that would be specific to the group’s needs. Such considerations and possibilities might influence legislators and government officials not to support a Canadians with Disabilities Act.</li>

                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Over the years, various federal governments conducted investigations into the creation of legislation aimed at supporting the rights of people with disabilities, but in the end, very little change occurred. Many of the people with disabilities who were involved in the process “were disillusioned as a result of the extensive amount of work involved with little or no results. There is a concern about expending energy to repeat a failure. The resources could be better spent by improving the effectiveness of the current laws and systems” (Kerzner and Baker, 1999).</li>

                    	<p>The Council of Canadians with Disabilities (CCD), formerly known as the Coalition of Provincial Organizations of the Handicapped (COPOH), was founded in 1976 by people with disabilities. The organization was formed because people with disabilities, facing discrimination and exclusion, wanted an accessible and inclusive society; that is, a Canada where people with disabilities have the opportunity to work, volunteer, go to school, have a family, and participate in recreational, sports-related, and cultural activities.</p>

                    	<p>Over the last 30 years, there has been a shift in thinking about disability. Through the human rights work of organizations like CCD, it has been recognized that traditional medical approaches to disability have not significantly improved the social or economic position of people with disabilities. CCD has been encouraging Canada’s decision makers to adopt a human rights approach to disability issues that focuses on barrier removal.</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-418" class="ch-link"></a>The <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-8">Independent Living Movement (ILM)</span> has been a key player in the struggle to achieve human rights legislation for people with disabilities. Originating in the United States in the early 1970s and introduced to Canada in 1979, the philosophy underlying the Independent Living Movement (ILM) is to encourage and assist persons with disabilities achieve self-direction over the personal and community services needed to attain their own independent living.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Origins and Philosophy of the ILM</p>

<p>The origins of the Independent Living Movement can be traced to the Cowell Residence Program at the University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1960s, students with severe disabilities were housed in Cowell Hospital on campus. A group of students with disabilities began to recognize that medical and rehabilitation professionals largely controlled their lives. Their efforts to take back control inspired the ILM and the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-9">disability rights movement</span> of the 1970s and continue to do so&#160;today.</p>

<p>Three major events in 1981 were central to the full development of the ILM in Canada: (1) the United Nations&rsquo; declaration of the International Year of Disabled Persons, (2) the Canadian government&rsquo;s release of Obstacles, its report concerning disability, and (3) the personal commitment of one of its founding members, Henry Enns, to the independent living (IL) philosophy. These helped provide legitimacy to the social oppression approach to disability and promoted the philosophy of IL to the various levels of government, academics, and other disability&#160;organizations.</p>

<p>By 1985, Independent Living Resource Centres (ILRCs) were operating in Waterloo, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, Calgary, and Toronto. In 1986, the Canadian Association of Independent Living Centres (CAILC) was formed to act as a national coordinating body for the ILM. In 2008, CAILC changed their name to Independent Living Canada. In 2015, a total of 25 ILRCs were operating across Canada.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Empowering Persons with Disabilities</p>

<p>According to the IL philosophy, persons with disabilities are citizens with the right to participate in community life. It therefore advocates an alternative model of program delivery. The IL philosophy empowers consumers to make the choices that are necessary to control their community and personal resources. Consumer control means that ILRCs are governed and controlled by persons with disabilities. ILRCs are non-profit and responsive to persons with all types of disabilities, including mobility, sensory, cognitive, emotional, psychiatric, and so forth.</p>

<p>In 1997, the CAILC undertook a study of the effects of the ILRCs and found that they succeed, in large part, not simply because they provide an opportunity to learn skills, access information, and receive support, but because they do so in a way that is consistent with the independent living philosophy. The Association concluded that improvement in the quality of life for people with disabilities requires skill development as well as the removal of environmental, social, and economic barriers.</p>

<p>Individual empowerment was found to be a key benefit. It was particularly important in fostering competency in a variety of community living skills, as well as resulting in increased confidence and self-esteem. The Association found that individuals involved with some of the programs of the ILRC have knowledge of other IL programs as well, and highly value the programs with which they are directly involved.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Provincial and Territorial Disparities</p>

<p>Canadians have a universal public health-care system, but the benefits do not extend to providing full support for all people with disabilities. The primary similarity across the provinces and territories is the range and types of supports and services provided. Provincial and territorial programs, whether in Newfoundland, British Columbia, or Yukon, will cover the cost of wheelchairs, canes, eyeglasses, walkers, attendant care services, home care, transportation, and so forth. The differences are in the eligibility requirements and the amount of funding for the various supports and services. Some provinces, such as Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick, have a single-tier program wherein services are directly funded by the province to the individual. Others, such as Nova Scotia and Manitoba, have a two-tier system: basically, provincial funding is transferred to the local government, which, in turn, funds the individual. There are also provincial programs based on specific legislation. In Ontario, people with disabilities are covered under the Ontario Disability Support Program Act; in British Columbia, they are covered under the Disability Benefits Program Act; and in Alberta, they receive benefits through the Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped Persons program.</p>

<p>Although there are many differences in the income support programs across Canada, one important similarity remains, and it concerns eligibility. All individuals with disabilities and/or their family members who apply for support are assessed first for disability. That determination is made by a medical professional. This process is then followed by an assessment for benefits, since merely having a disability does not necessarily qualify the individual and/or family members for coverage. Every applicant from St. John&rsquo;s to Vancouver is assessed according to a &ldquo;means test,&rdquo; which basically investigates bank accounts, saving bonds, household income, trust funds, and so on. Since provincial and territorial programs are &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo; welfare programs, individual assets cannot be greater than the amount being applied for. For example, an individual might be eligible for $600.00 per month, but if their income is $250.00 per month, then this amount is deducted from the $600.00 and they will receive $350.00 as a monthly payment.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Determining Levels of Benefits for Persons with Disabilities</p>

<p><a href="#" id="page-421" class="ch-link"></a>Once a person is deemed to have a disability, a rigourous Social Assistance review takes place to determine the exact level of benefits that are due. No stone seems to be left unturned in this assessment process.</p>

<p>As noted, first there is an investigation of assets. Only if one&rsquo;s assets are deemed to be within the parameters of program funding will they receive coverage under the provincial or territorial program. The next step in a Social Assistance review is a needs test, consisting of three additional steps:</p>
	<ul class="ul--list">
		
		<li class="li--bullet-item">The applicant&rsquo;s basic requirements for living are identified (food, clothing, shelter, utilities, other household expenses, and personal allowances). Each requirement is designated with a maximum dollar allotment, and the requirements are then totalled to determine the funds needed to meet basic needs.</li>

		<li class="li--bullet-item">The applicant&rsquo;s available financial resources are determined, that is, income from resources such as pensions, including public or private funds, savings, or money received through paid employment or training programs.</li>

		<li class="li--bullet-item">The difference between total resources and total basic needs is then calculated. A negative remainder indicates a &ldquo;budget defect.&rdquo; If this is the case, then the applicant is considered eligibile for assistance.</li>

	</ul>
<p>The amount of assistance will then be determined according to a variety of factors, including size of family, degree of employability of the family&rsquo;s main decision maker, size and type of accommodation, and so on.</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">The onset of disability greatly affects the entire family unit</p>

                        <p>What skills should social workers have in order to work effectively with people with disabilities? Social workers should obviously have general practice skills, which include an understanding of individual and family counselling, as well as group work and community organization. In addition, they should have a knowledge of mediation and advocacy and be able to connect clients to available resources.</p>

                        <p>But to be effective, whether with persons with disabilities or with other groups, a social worker must be able to help an individual and family cope, while at the same time recognizing that many of their difficulties likely stem from the social and political contexts in which they find themselves. At times, the social worker may need to become a direct advocate for social and political change with, and on behalf of, his or her clients. This may involve petitioning for more or better services, organizing clients to protest a lack of accessible housing, or supporting boycotts against businesses that are not accessible to people with&#160;disabilities.</p>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Disability and Social Work Practice</p>

                        <p>Following are some of the issues that social workers should consider as they support individuals and family members who are adjusting to the onset of disability.</p>

                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Emotional coping and functioning skills. </span>The intensity and impact of disability on an individual or a family may be influenced by their experiences with previous life crises. People who have dealt effectively with previous crises may have acquired problem-solving and coping skills that can be used again to help them deal with the the onset of disability. If the social worker is aware of this, he or she can build on these strengths and help individuals and family members apply these skills in the new situation.</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">The family’s post-trauma functioning. </span>It is important for the social worker to help individuals and family members recognize their strengths and to find, maintain, and develop resources and supports. These include “internal supports,” such as strong, effective relationships between family members, spouses’/partners’ stability, and strong parent–child bonds, as well as the effective decision-making and problem-solving skills of the family members. They also include “external supports,” such as extended family members, friends, peer support, self-help groups, community resources, and supportive outside environments, such as the school or&#160;workplace.</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">The person’s status within the family. </span>The impact of disability on a family is influenced by who has become disabled. For example, is the person a newborn, an infant, a spouse or partner, the primary wage earner, the primary decision maker, or the individual who provides most of the emotional support for other family members? Each circumstance will be different, and each will call for a particular type of response with respect to how family members may or may not cope with the onset of disability.</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">The person’s stage in the life cycle. </span>The life cycle stage of the individual who has become disabled will influence how the family copes. For example, if the onset of chronic illness or impairment comes late in life, family members may have had an opportunity to plan. However, if the onset of disability comes earlier (as a consequence of birth impairment or injury, for example), the family may be affected quite differently. For example, a young couple may encounter financial difficulties resulting from a loss of income, and, depending on the type of disability, intimacy and sexuality may be affected. For other families, the birth of a child who has significant impairments may dramatically alter the hopes, plans, and dreams of the parents. Each situation is unique and will require its own solution.</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">&#9;The nature and extent of the disability. </span>The onset of disability can lead to many new relationships between family members and professionals (especially medical professionals). Uncertainty, use of medical jargon, and lack of information can create tension and frustration for family members. To be able to cope effectively, family members must be treated with dignity and respect, and they need to be involved in all aspects of treatment. In many situations, the social worker is a member of a multidisciplinary team, and part of his or her role is to advocate for the individual and the family in relation to the professional support services being&#160;provided.</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">&#9;Access to resources. </span>The impact of disability on a family unit is often influenced by the availability of community resources. Such services include support networks, daycare, schools, jobs, attendant care, retraining, respite care, hospice care, transportation, and recreational facilities. Other important factors include access to financial resources, including private pensions, insurance plans, or government-sponsored financial programs, such as the Canada Pension Plan and provincial financial assistance programs. Helping families access financial, community, social, recreational and/or medical resources is often central to the social&#160;work practitioner’s role.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Support for Families</p>

                        <p>Until the 1970s, the medical care and treatment of both children and adults with disabilities was predominantly directed at the physical needs of the individual who was disabled. Less attention was paid to the emotional needs of the individual and the needs of his or her family.</p>

                        <p>During the past 25 years, however, there has been a greater recognition of the importance of the family and family members. This new focus was influenced by the introduction of family systems theory to social work. This theory argues that the family is an interrelated network and that an impact on one component of that network has significant consequences for all other components in the system. In other words, according to the family systems theory,</p>

                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">all parts of the family unit are interrelated,</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item">each member affects and is affected by other members of the unit, and</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item">no single part of the family system can be understood in isolation from other parts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Obviously, the onset of disability, whether at birth or later in life, will have a great effect the entire family unit. Family members (especially parents of a child with a disability) therefore have a critical role to play in the care, treatment, and emotional adjustment of the person who is disabled. Much of the work of the social work practitioner must therefore focus on the people on whom the person with the disability will increasingly depend.</p>

					<p><a href="#" id="page-424" class="ch-link"></a>In Tammy&rsquo;s story, a social worker encounters a young woman with developmental disabilities who wishes to move out of her parents&rsquo; home and into her own apartment. Two issues of particular concern that need to be addressed are sexuality counselling and employability skills/job-readiness training.</p>

<p>A social worker&rsquo;s role in providing sexuality counselling requires a foundation of trust, care, and acceptance of the client&rsquo;s wishes. The goal is not to judge but to provide a service. It is important for social workers to remember that people with developmental disabilities have the same interest in sexuality as their non-disabled peers do. But due to the stigma attached to people with developmental disabilities, many clients do not receive appropriate information, support, and guidance. It has only been in the past two decades or so that social workers have provided sexuality counselling to people with developmental disabilities, as sexuality was once considered a taboo area. Indeed, historical accounts of people with developmental disabilities, especially women, reveal decades of forced sterilization of this population. Although the stigmatizing elements of sexuality and disability have been challenged in recent years, many people still view persons with disabilities as being asexual. This is not the reality, however. Persons with developmental disabilities are as drawn to sexual intimacy as are their non-disabled peers. Given this reality, effective social work practice must view a client&rsquo;s interest in exploring his or her sexuality as healthy and appropriate rather than problematic.</p>

<p>Once the social worker and the client commit to addressing issues related to sexuality, the social worker must be able to provide guidance, support, and information in a manner that the client can understand. Hence, the social worker should have training and expertise in this area. An important element of sexuality counselling is the provision of information about a wide range of issues, including socially appropriate private and public behaviours, safe sex, sexually transmitted diseases, wanted and unwanted advances, intercourse, contraception, pregnancy, parenting skills, self/other masturbation, and same-sex relationships. Literature regarding developmental disability and sexuality further suggests that the social worker may have to provide counselling about the mechanics of sex, coping with difficulties in relationships (including rejection and loss), and the facts about menstruation. Adults with developmental disabilities are often at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation. Therefore, sexuality counselling must also address the potential for harm and how clients can protect themselves.</p>

<p>Another area of focus for the social worker and the client is inquiry into subsidized housing options for people with disabilities. Canadians who can live independently and who are in receipt of a recognized disability pension, or who are considered disabled for income tax purposes, are eligible to apply for subsidized housing, which is rent geared to income. Social workers can help clients research the availability of social, non-profit, co-operative, or supportive housing; the eligibility criteria; and the application process. Because wait times for subsidized and supportive housing can be as long as ten years, it is often necessary to explore the availability of modest, non-subsidized housing that a client can afford.</p>

		                <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-425" class="ch-link"></a>Young adults with developmental disabilities experience the same “growing pains” as others do, as they strive to establish a separate identity from their parents, explore their sexuality, and seek a degree of independence from the family unit. Social workers can help these young adults and their families navigate some potentially complex situations.</p>

<p>Tammy, 25, has a mild to moderate developmental disability and has lived with her family for her entire life. For ten months now, Tammy has been enrolled in various social and recreational day programs provided through a local agency for adults who have disabilities.</p>

<p>Although Tammy has no job income, she receives a monthly cheque for $1,100 through the province’s Disability Support Program. Her father, who oversees Tammy’s financial affairs, gives her an allowance of $75 per week and deposits the remainder into a bank account for Tammy.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, Tammy and her parents have developed a good rapport with Britney, one of the young social workers at the agency. One aspect of Britney’s job is to provide information, referrals, and supportive counselling to clients and their family members.</p>

<p>One day, Tammy visits Britney in her office and tells Britney that she would like to move out of her parents’ home, possibly into her own apartment if she can obtain supported living resources. She is willing to learn more independent living skills, such as cooking and managing her own money. Tammy is also interested in broadening her social skills; eventually she would like to volunteer or work in the community.</p>

<p>Tammy tells Britney that her mother Ellen thinks Tammy will do well, as long as she has plenty of support and guidance. Tammy’s father, however, is not as encouraging. Peter worries about Tammy being out on her own and wants her to continue to live at home.</p>

<p>In addition to her desire for financial and social independence, Tammy confides to Britney that she has developed a relationship with Josh, a young man with mild developmental disabilities who attends the same programs at the agency that Tammy does. Tammy discloses to Britney that she and Josh would like to date and possibly live together one day, but she acknowledges that this is a long-term plan and that they want to take time to get to know each other better before committing to a serious intimate relationship. Tammy indicates to Britney that for now, she would really like some information and counselling about healthy relationships and sexuality, as she has many questions and concerns about this area of adulthood.</p>

<p>Because of Tammy’s mild to moderate cognitive impairment, Britney must keep in mind that Tammy will need to learn at her own pace. She may have some difficulties retaining information, and she may need help in terms of her literacy skills. Britney locates some books at an appropriate reading level and some online educational videos that she believes will help fill in some gaps in Tammy’s understanding of human sexuality.</p>

<p>As part of a respectful counselling process, Britney must take care, as much as possible, to leave final decisions about sexuality and sexual activity up to Tammy. However, a concern for safety might arise if Tammy’s relationship with Josh were to end and Tammy were to seek out new partners. Therefore, Britney talks openly with Tammy about the need for Tammy to learn how to be assertive with others and how to safeguard her physical and emotional safety in her dealings not only with Josh but also with possible future romantic partners. They determine together that Tammy will need to learn more about safe sex, contraception, and techniques for avoiding being pressured into having sex before she feels ready.</p>

<p>Tammy realizes that she will need to prove to her father that she is capable of living independently. She and Britney decide that another important part of Tammy’s plan to establish self-sufficiency is to search for affordable housing that would suit a young person with developmental disabilities. They go online to find out for which subsidized housing programs Tammy might qualify. Together, Britney and Tammy learn how to submit an online application to non-profit and cooperative housing providers. They also search for nearby, inexpensive studio apartment vacancies. Tammy is excited that she is moving forward in her quest for adult decision-making power and autonomy.</p>

					<p><a href="#" id="page-426" class="ch-link"></a>The Shadbous&rsquo; story pertains to a child with multiple disabilities. It reflects the interplay of systems at different levels of complexity that influences the family situation, while also acknowledging parental grief. Disability in a cross-cultural context also plays a role.</p>

<p>Research suggests that when a child with a disability is a member of a racial or cultural minority, the parents and child often have more difficulty accessing supports and services compared to non-racialized families. Zoebia et al. found that children of colour who have disabilities experienced being disabled quite differently compared to their white peers with disabilities because they experienced racism as well as ableism: &ldquo;Many obstacles were rooted in institutional racism&rdquo; (960). Studies regarding visible and ethnic minority children with disabilities indicate that this population faces significant obstacles in accessing health, social services, education, employment, and support services. In addition, the concerns of this population do not seem to be a priority for disability rights organizations or disability-related service agencies.</p>

<p>In some societies, the birth of a child with disabilities is considered a punishment from God, which makes the parents feel ashamed and reluctant to seek supports and services. Compounding these difficulties is the cultural belief that families are supposed to take care of their own, and thus seeking assistance from agencies is highly stigmatized, which inhibits many parents from seeking outside help. Many parents feel that they need to &ldquo;save face&rdquo; in their own extended families and cultural and religious communities, and thus do not apply for supports and services. Moreover, because of religious and cultural beliefs, parents may feel intimidated and misunderstood when applying for services. For example, observant Muslims may feel very uncomfortable with mixed-gender programs (Zoebia et al., 2006). Another reason why new immigrant parents, in particular, do not seek support for a child with disabilities is that they risk being deported if they do not have citizenship. As a matter of policy, Canada does not accept people with disabilities. Under section 19 of the Immigration and Refugee Act, people with disabilities can be denied permission to remain in Canada (Hanes, 2010). Fearing deportation, many new immigrant parents become very apprehensive when it comes to seeking out services for a child with a disability.</p>

<p>To work effectively with racialized or immigrant children who have disabilities, it is not only important that social workers develop an understanding of the impact of disability on family dynamics, but they must also develop practice skills based on cultural competence. This concept derives from the late 1980s, but being culturally competent is just as important today as it was 25 years ago. Cultural competence refers to &ldquo;a program&rsquo;s ability to honour and respect those beliefs, interpersonal styles, attitudes, and behaviours of both families who are clients and the multicultural staff who are providing services. In so doing, it incorporates these values at the levels of policy, administration, and practice&rdquo; (Roberts et al., 1990). Cross, Bazron, Dennis, and Isaacs (1989) identify five core principles of cultural competence that can be applied to social work practice with families whose children have disabilities: valuing diversity, conducting a cultural self-assessment, recognizing and understanding the dynamics of difference, acquiring cultural knowledge, and adapting to diversity.</p>

		                <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-427" class="ch-link"></a>Parents who have recently learned that their child has a disability can benefit greatly from the professional support of a social worker. Not only do they need guidance navigating the medical system and information about the services available to their child, but their new reality calls for an empathetic ear and, often, individual and/or couples counselling.</p>
<p>Mr. and Ms. Shadbou first presented themselves to the Children&rsquo;s Treatment Centre when they moved back to Canada after having lived in the Middle East for a few years. Their son, Omar, aged six, has been diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy, as well as a developmental disability. His health was seriously compromised, and he was considered medically fragile. One of the Shadbous&rsquo; primary concerns was that Omar did not yet have his Ontario Health Card&mdash;and he urgently required medical treatment and intervention.</p>
<p>As the social worker assigned to this case, my role was to communicate with the local children&rsquo;s hospital as well as with other community partners to help them understand the dire nature of Omar&rsquo;s medical status and to urge them to be ready to offer services as soon as possible once Omar&rsquo;s health card arrived. Omar&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; priority was to have everything in place for a surgery that would allow Omar to be fed by means of a gastronomic tube, as he was at risk of failure to thrive. He also needed costly medication to help manage a seizure disorder.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I were able to advocate within our own organization to have the fees paid for by the Family Emergency Fund until Omar&rsquo;s family received his health card. The surgery was successful, and Omar has been gaining weight steadily.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Collaborating to Optimize a Child&rsquo;s Quality of Life</p>

<p>Mr. and Ms. Shadbou both have a university education. Ms. Shadbou stays at home full time caring for Omar and his two-year-old sister. Mr. Shadbou has not been able to secure employment in his field since returning to Canada and has been cleaning office buildings in the evenings to support the family. He has been taking courses in order to enhance his employability. The Shadbous attend many appointments with Omar, and they manage to cooperate effectively in assuming child-care responsibilities. Ms. Shadbou does not yet have her driver&rsquo;s license and often feels isolated and lonely when her husband is not home. Few extended family members have been supportive because they seem to feel uncomfortable and even embarrassed when the topic of Omar&rsquo;s disabilities arises. This alienation from their family is compounding the Shadbous&rsquo; grief. Thus, the couple planned to join a network of parents who can relate to their unique situation. Mr. and Ms. Shadbou were keen to learn about the scope of services available to them, including respite offered by the local children&rsquo;s care home to help them regain some balance in their lives.</p>
<p>It is not easy for parents to accept that they need to seek help from such a facility. It is especially difficult for immigrants such as the Shadbous, who value self-sufficiency and self-determination and who do not wish to be perceived as a burden upon their adopted country. In a scenario such as this, parents need the help of professionals who are academically qualified, emotionally reassuring, and culturally competent. They need to know that their feelings will be respected, that their pain will be acknowledged, and that they will not be judged negatively.</p>
<p>I took care to ensure that Mr. and Ms. Shadbou were aware of the process whereby Omar could enter the education system, and I helped them make knowledgeable decisions about the most suitable classroom environment. Coordinating and communicating the details of Omar&rsquo;s care with education consultants and transportation representatives was crucial to the success of this transition.</p>
<p>One of the most complicated realities for families of children with complex physical needs is determining&mdash;together with physicians, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist&mdash;what type of equipment would be most beneficial, and at what point. Often, items such as wheelchairs, ceiling tracks, hospital beds, bath chairs, and standing frames must be procured. It is important for the team to work with the parents to review the various vendors who provide such equipment and to identify possible funding sources. Mr. and Ms. Shadbou have been active participants in collaborating with the numerous professionals involved in their lives to ensure that Omar is getting what he needs for an optimal quality of life.</p>

					<p><a href="#" id="page-428" class="ch-link"></a>From the early 1950s until the early 1970s, the treatment of persons with disabilities focused on the individual only, and little or no attention was paid to the needs of family members. In fact, it was not too long ago that family members, including parents of children with disabilities, were considered a hindrance to treatment. As a result, people with disabilities were often removed from their families to be housed and treated in hospitals, rehabilitation centres, and institutions, which allowed only minimal contact with family, friends, and the outside world.</p>

<p>Indeed, during this period, very little attention was paid to the psychological and emotional effects of the disability on the individual or on family members. Rather, the focus of treatment tended to take only the &ldquo;physical body&rdquo; into account, ignoring the intellectual, psychological, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of a person with a disability.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Toward a Strengths-Based Practice</p>

<p>Since the late 1970s, health-care professionals have come to realize that the consequences of disability go far beyond the individual, and that, in reality, the disablement of one person has an effect on everyone connected to that person. There has been a shift in attitude wherein not only is an individual&rsquo;s emotional and pychological state deemed to be important, but family members are now viewed as essential elements of the rehabilitation and treatment process.</p>

<p>Over the years, a number of theories have attempted to explain the &ldquo;stages of adjustment&rdquo; through which families progress when coping with the onset of disability. Such theories have generally been found wanting insofar as they provide minimal reliability when it comes to positive adjustment to the onset of disability. Newer approaches have more validity. Power and Dell Orto (1980), for example, have outlined some effective guidelines in helping families adjust to disability. The key to effective social work in this area is to incorporate a strengths-based model of practice. Their approach includes the following:</p>

<ul class="ul--list">
	<li class="li--bullet-item">Respect and acceptance of each family&rsquo;s culture, ethnicity, structure, roles, values, belief systems, and ways of coping</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item">Recognition and acceptance of the strengths of families: family members, including the extended family kinship network, are most consistently involved in the provision of care, and so are able to provide valuable information and knowledge</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item">Close family&ndash;professional collaboration is essential so that both families and professionals can share information and learn skills to help in assessment and problem solving</li>

	<li class="li--bullet-item">Inclusion of family members as part of the decision-making process with regard to all aspects of care, treatment, and follow-up</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether they are parents, siblings, or grandparents, family members will often be affected in some way by the disablement of a loved one. With this in mind, social workers must remain aware that family members are struggling with various losses and so may be in need of professional support as well.</p>

<p>An approach that builds on the strengths, support networks, and resources available to family members can lead to positive outcomes for all those presented with the onset of a loved one&rsquo;s disability. The Rayners&rsquo; story demonstrates such an approach on the part of a social worker.</p>

		                <p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-429" class="ch-link"></a>Many parents who have children with disabilities prioritize everything except their own needs, and their relationship can suffer as a result. Parents need support in finding ways to boost their reserves of energy and strengthen their bond. This story demonstrates how a social worker can help couples adapt to their child&rsquo;s disability in positive ways. A strengths-based perspective assumes that most of the time, people can and do adapt to significant challenges in their lives in ways that provide them with renewed strength and increased energy.</p>

<p>I met Mr. and Mrs. Rayner following their appointment with the psychologist who had diagnosed both of their five-year-old twin boys with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Understandably, this diagnosis was very hard on the Rayners. My role was to help them work through the emotional difficulties associated with raising children with a disability, while also assisting them in accessing the various community resources for which they are eligible.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rayner is a stay-at-home mother, and Mr. Rayner is in the process of starting his own business, which has required a great deal of his time and energy for the past several months. According to both parents, they have been &ldquo;just surviving&rdquo; and are feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. They have very limited family support, and there are no family members with whom they feel comfortable leaving the twins.</p>

<p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Intervention</p>

<p>Like most parents of children with special needs, Mr. and Mrs. Rayner felt that their priority was to ensure that all applications to community programs had been completed before they addressed the impact of the situation upon themselves as a couple. They were eligible to apply for programs through the Ministry of Community and Social Services, which would extend financial assistance so that they could hire a worker to provide respite. They also wanted to ensure that they were connected to the community agency that offers Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) interventions, the empirically accepted treatment for persons with ASD. Mrs. Rayner had previously researched a number of alternative interventions&mdash;for example, a dietary change involving probiotics, which seemed to be benefitting both boys.</p>

<p>When addressing the impact of the diagnosis on the marital relationship, it was important to identify some of the losses experienced by both Mr. and Mrs. Rayner. Often, parents of children with a disability suffer a financial loss because one parent cannot work outside the home, and because the costs associated with the child&rsquo;s increased needs can be substantial. Grief also results from the loss of parents&rsquo; initial hopes, dreams, and expectations for their child. For Mr. and Mrs. Rayner, one of the most significant losses was the lack of free time for each of them individually but also as a couple. Mr. Rayner was focused on the start-up of a new business, while Mrs. Rayner was responsible for all of the household and child-related tasks. There was little time left to relax.</p>

<p>I helped Mrs. Rayner feel more confident in expressing her feelings to her husband and revealing that she would like to find ways to connect with him on a more regular basis. She had feared that raising this topic would cause her husband to feel additional stress and that he might therefore reject her request. Mr. Rayner was, in fact, quite open to making a greater effort to sustain the health of the marriage. They discovered that they were both interested in exploring what they could do together that did not necessarily take up a lot of time but that would strengthen their relationship.</p>

<p>I shared some insights into the importance of effective communication for couples. Many parents who have children with a disability focus on everything except their own needs and their partner&rsquo;s needs. Relationships can start to buckle as communication weakens. If a couple overlooks these problems, they can become distanced from each other over time.</p>

<p>I worked with Mr. and Mrs. Rayner to devise a plan whereby they would arrange for respite care one evening a week so that they can visit friends, go out for a walk and a coffee, or browse through their favourite bookstore together. Enjoying unstructured time together as a couple will help replenish their energy levels and strengthen their sense of partnership as they confront the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

						<p class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-430" class="ch-link"></a>Barb Juett received her Bachelor of Social Work degree from Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario in 1987. While there, she benefitted from two excellent practicums, one at the John Howard Society and the other at the Elizabeth Fry Society. At the time, she was intrigued by the criminal justice system, but her career path took a different turn.</p>

<p>My education at Laurentian provided a solid foundation and an opportunity to develop my assessment and interviewing skills. After graduation, rather than pursuing work in the criminal justice field, I moved to Ottawa. Jobs were available there, and I managed to find employment at a group home for children with severe autism. This was one of a few specialized group homes operated by the Ottawa Children&rsquo;s Aid Society. After about a year, a social work position became available, and I was accepted as a member of a Child Protection Team. For the next ten years, I gained experience in child protection, as well as in intake services and adoption.</p>

<p>It would be fair to say that this was an eye-opening period in my life. Having been raised in a stable, middle-class family, I was at times unprepared for the level of poverty and the substandard home environments of some of the families we served. Education about family violence, substance use disorders, and oppression came not from a textbook but from exposure to the realities we were facing. I am still thankful for the support of my colleagues and supervisors, who shared their wisdom and knowledge with me during some emotionally challenging situations.</p>

<p>While I was working at the Ottawa Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, my supervisor encouraged me to pursue a Masters of Social Work degree. This was an opportunity that I could not pass up, as the organization was willing to cover the cost of my tuition. I was accepted at McGill University in Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec, and moved away from my husband and friends for a year to live in a city where I didn&rsquo;t know anyone.</p>

<p>Over the years, my social work career has focused primarily on children and youth. Following ten years with the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society, I sought a new direction, which led to employment at the Ottawa Children&rsquo;s Treatment Centre (OCTC). I have been working at the OCTC since 1998.</p>

<p>A primary role of social workers at the OCTC is working with the families of children with disabilities, particularly parents,</p>

<p>to ensure that the child receives appropriate services and to assist parents (as well as other family members) in coping with the day-to-day stresses and strains of raising a child who has one or more disabilities. Over the years, my social work practice has included the provision of supportive counselling as well as helping family members gain access to the many resources that children with disabilities need. Obtaining necessary resources sometimes included advocating for provincial government programs, working with school boards, and liaising with other professionals, such as doctors, physiotherapists, teachers, nurses, and occupational therapists. Throughout my career in working with children with disabilities, a core piece of my role as social worker has been communicating and interacting with professionals, agencies, and bureaucracies. Therefore, my role can be considered a multi-systemic one.</p>

<p>Presently, as the Professional Practice Leader for the Social Work Department at OCTC, one of my primary responsibilities is supervising social work services for the organization. While I have worked in a variety of capacities throughout my career, my areas of specialization now include grief counselling as well as addressing issues and concerns experienced by the siblings of children with disabilities.</p>

<p>In closing, I must add that like the social work role within many organizations, my social work activity goes beyond the bounds of the OCTC. I am involved with multi-service committees such as the Complex Care Advisory Committee for the Ottawa area. This is a multi-organization committee comprising agencies that serve families of children with multiple complex needs.</p>

<p>Last but not least, part of my professional life includes education. I teach an online course in the Autism and Behaviour Sciences Program offered by Algonguin College in Ottawa.</p>
