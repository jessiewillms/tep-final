                <p>What feminist author Betty Friedan referred to in the 1950s as “the problem with no name” very soon received a name and a proposed solution—women’s inequality and women’s liberation. Gender inequality persists to this day, however, and harm and violence against women take many forms. The death and disappearance of hundreds, if not thousands, of Indigenous women in Canada is just one of many issues causing concern among social workers, policy makers, and the country as a whole about the treatment of women and girls in our society.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">Helen Levine (1923– ) is a radical feminist and former social worker. In her writings, she challenged traditional views of mothering, critiqued psychiatry for defining women through a patriarchal lens, and offered an alternative way of working with women through feminist counselling. At the School of Social Work at Carleton University, Levine pushed the parameters of structural social work to include a feminist analysis, introducing women’s issues and feminist perspectives into the curriculum for the first time.</p>

                    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
                        <p>The modern movement for greater participation by women in public life first arose toward the end of the nineteenth century. Its subsequent history is frequently described as appearing and re-appearing in three or four different waves.</p>
                        <p>The First Wave of the feminist movement (approximately 1840s&ndash;1920s) had a number of strands, including the temperance movement, women&rsquo;s missionary and charitable activities, and the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">suffragette movement.</span> The temperance movement focused on the prohibition of alcohol (because of its devastating effects on male breadwinners, and therefore, on women and children). Missionary and charitable activities provided an opportunity for women to become involved in public life, and the suffragette movement fought for and ultimately won women&rsquo;s right to vote. Women became involved in the Women&rsquo;s Christian Temperance Union, the National Council of Women, the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association (YWCA), and church missionary societies and charities (the Protestant Orphans Homes, homes for unmarried mothers, homes for the aged, and settlement houses). These groups were also the forerunners of the social work profession. Women were involved in campaigns to improve conditions for nursing mothers, in organizations that provided care for people with tuberculosis and other illnesses, and in providing assistance to families of veterans. For example, when the federal government agreed to pay an allowance to support the families of men who had died in the First World War, a group of Manitoba women (including suffragette Nellie McClung) campaigned for a similar benefit for the families of men who died in peacetime. In 1916, Manitoba introduced the Mothers&rsquo; Allowance&mdash;Canada&rsquo;s first legislated welfare program.</p>
                        <p>The Second Wave of the feminist movement occurred during the 1960s&ndash;1980s, when inequality in the wider society became a focus of concern. The phrase &ldquo;the personal is political&rdquo; emerged during this period, identifying the impact of sexism and patriarchy on women&rsquo;s lives. A core focus involved the breaking down of gender stereotypes. This Second Wave had a profound impact on social work through the rise of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">consciousness-raising groups</span> that questioned gender roles and traditional power relations in society. However, there were a few limitations. One was that women were treated as a homogenous group, and attention was therefore focused mostly on the concerns of white, middle-class women. For example, in bell&#160;hooks&rsquo;&#160;book Ain&rsquo;t I a Woman, the author notes the devaluation of racialized women within the feminist movement.</p>
                        <p>This changed with the Third Wave (1980s&ndash;2000s), which drew more attention to the multiple forms of feminism. The idea of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-3">intersectionality</span> arose during this period, calling for a recognition that gender, ability, age, race, sexuality, class, and nationality intersect in shaping women&rsquo;s experiences. This more inclusive approach continues to influence social work practice today.</p>
                        <p>According to Phillips and Cree (2014), we are now entering a Fourth Wave, defined by the proliferation of new technologies that have major implications for social work practice. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs)&mdash;texting, social media, blogs, and online platforms&shy;&mdash;have transformed how people discuss critical issues, with young women aged 18&ndash;29 being the highest users of social networking sites (Pew Research Center, 2011). While some question whether the increased use of ICTs represents a clear Fourth Wave, these new platforms are certainly facilitating participation in feminist organizations and advocacy. The Canadian Association for Social Work Education (CASWE) is actively considering some of the effects of new media on social work practice.</p>

                        <p>Before continuing, it may be useful to identify several key terms:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">Gender.</span> Gender has come to refer to the characteristics that identify the social relations between men and women, or the ways in which this relationship is socially constructed. Gender is a relational term similar to the concepts of class and race, and it is an analytical tool for understanding social relations and processes.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">Gender equality.</span> Gender equality means women and men live in a society that affords them equal opportunity to realize full human rights; to contribute as equal citizens to national, political, economic, social, and cultural development; and to benefit from the results.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-6">Sexism.</span> Sexism refers to prejudice or discrimination based on a person&rsquo;s sex. It is a system of discriminatory physical and social controls, derogatory beliefs, and institutional- and societal-level policies. Sexism can be blatant or subtle; it can take the form of derogatory language or lead to the denial of career opportunities based on a person&rsquo;s sex.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">Patriarchy.</span> Patriarchy literally means &ldquo;rule by the father,&rdquo; but in a broader sense, it has come to mean the domination of society by men and male interests. Men continue to be represented in higher numbers in positions of authority, and male interests continue to take precedence over those of females.</li>

                        <p>While women were becoming more engaged in public life in the twentieth century, they were not doing so on equal terms with men. &ldquo;Excluded in large part from the male-dominated fields of business, government, and the professions, a new generation of college-educated women after the turn of the century provided a large pool of available labour for the emerging fields of nursing, teaching, library science, and social work&rdquo; (Struthers, 1991: 128). Delegates to a 1929 conference on equal pay pointed out that women were generally paid less than men for work of equal value. This is often still the case today.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Moving Very Slowly toward Employment Equity</p>
                        <p>The economic crisis of the 1930s&mdash;also known as the Great Depression&mdash;did little to improve women&rsquo;s employment prospects. From the 1950s onward, however, more and more Canadian women entered the labour force, although rarely on equal terms with men. In addition, the industries and occupations initially open to women were generally less prestigious. Women&rsquo;s incomes were inferior to those of men in the same occupations, and all sorts of justifications for this fundamental inequality seemed to be readily available. Furthermore, patriarchal norms were still in force within the family: women were expected to tend to their children, husband, and household affairs, as well as earn an income outside the home. In the 1960s, salaries for women did begin to improve somewhat, with the expansion of employment opportunities in the social services sector.</p>
                        <p>Many legislative changes and policy initiatives in the post-World War II period were aimed at fostering greater equality for women at work. These included the following:</p>
                        

                            <ul class="ul--list">
                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-8">Equal-pay policies.</span>During the 1950s and 1960s, every Canadian province enacted legislation requiring equal pay for similar or substantially similar work. During the 1970s, both Qu&eacute;bec and the federal government introduced pay equity legislation that required equal pay for work of equal value (allowing comparisons between occupations). In the 1980s, most jurisdictions followed suit, at least with respect to public sector employment.</li>
                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-9">Equal employment</span> and  <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-10">employment equity</span>. All Canadian provinces now have equal employment legislation in place, usually as part of their human rights code, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, age, religion, nationality, or sex. Employment equity legislation, which requires or encourages proactive hiring practices in regard to identified groups, such as women, was not introduced in Canada until the 1980s. In 1996, employment equity legislation was expanded to include the federal public service, and this legislation became (and still is) required of federal contractors. Employment equity may also be required of cities and municipalities.</li>

Under pressure from women&rsquo;s organizations, many other changes were introduced in the postwar period to help put Canadian women on an equal footing with men in the labour market. These included changes in divorce laws, policies against sexual harassment at work, extended maternity leave, policies to protect part-time and temporary workers, and policies to ensure that women have equal access to higher education.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Such policies have helped to equalize employment opportunities for women, although there is still the overriding concern that women leave work at the end of the day only to find that they must still assume the &ldquo;double burden&rdquo; of work at home and in the family. Much more needs to be done to ensure wage parity and equal job opportunities for women in Canada.</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Mounting numbers of women—especially lone-parent mothers—are receiving social services across Canada. So disturbing is the problem that a phrase has been coined to capture it: ”the feminization of poverty.”</p>
                                            <p>The factors of gender, race, and social status all play a critical role in determining who is poor. Across Canada, women are more likely to live in conditions of poverty than men. The infographic below, produced by the Canadian Women’s Foundation, displays some disturbing facts about the high rate of poverty among women.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><span>Single Mothers</span></p>
                                            <p>The infographic shows that 21 percent of single mothers in Canada live in poverty. Women on their own are the poorest of the poor, especially those raising children single-handedly. The children of single mothers are almost four times more likely to be poor than those in two-parent families.</p>
                                            <p>Many factors create a situation in which one in five mothers is impoverished. Women spend more time than men doing unpaid work, such as child care, meal preparation, and housework. The lack of affordable child care in Canada also forces mothers to limit their career and education opportunities. In order to balance their work and home responsibilities, many women have no choice but to take employment that is precarious (positions that are part-time, seasonal, or contractual). The gender wage gap is another factor that contributes to increased rates of poverty among women rather than men. Jobs traditionally occupied by women pay less than jobs traditionally occupied by men.</p>
                                            <p>Children growing up in poverty are far more likely to experience food insecurity, poor health outcomes, and difficulty succeeding in school. Over the long term, boosting women’s economic status will benefit their children as well.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><span>Visible Minority Women</span></p>
                                            <p>Twenty-eight percent of women belonging to visible minority groups live in poverty and are likely to face additional stressors and barriers, including difficulty obtaining employment. Unemployment rates for immigrants are higher than those for Canadian-born individuals at every level of education—despite the fact that there are similar participation rates in the labour market. The high rate of poverty among women belonging to visible minority groups is likely the product of an interaction of factors associated with being a woman and being a member of a minority group. There are similar interactions between (1) being a woman in Canadian society and (2) unique factors associated with being Aboriginal, living with a disability, or being a single older woman.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red"><a href="#" id="page-251" class="ch-link">Aboriginal Women</a></p>
                                            <p>The infographic also shows that 37 percent of Aboriginal women in Canada live in poverty. An argument is sometimes made that the direct effects of colonialism and discrimination against Aboriginal peoples have worn off by now. This kind of argument makes light of the intergenerational impact that systemic racism and widespread policies of assimilation have had on Aboriginal peoples. It also ignores present-day policies and practices that negatively impact the health and economic well-being of Aboriginal women.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Women with Disabilities</p>
                                            <p>In Canada, 33 percent of women living in poverty have a disability. While a number of services, benefits, grants, and tax deductions are designed to support people living with disabilities, these programs do not adequately address the employment and economic barriers that women with disabilities face.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Older Women</p>
                                            <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development reported that in 2013, “the biggest increase in old-age poverty occurred among older women, especially those who were divorced or separated” (OECD, 2013). Older women who do not have job security, pension funds, or retirement savings risk finding themselves living in situations of poverty.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Addressing the Feminization of Poverty</p>
                                            <p>When the economy is weak, as it is now and as it is likely to be in the coming years, the poverty rate for women tends to rise even more. This is because women’s poverty is caused by different factors than men’s poverty.</p>
                                            <p>Men’s poverty is usually more directly related to low-wage employment, whereas women’s poverty arises from additional factors, such as divorce and separation, as well as their responsibilities as mothers, homemakers, and caregivers.</p>
                                            <p>Social workers should challenge governments at all levels to develop specific strategies to deal with women’s employment, child care, old-age security, family law, Social Assistance rates, and general income security. Investing in education and career-training programs for women can be of great aid to those who may be struggling to find adequate, full-time employment. Changes in policy that address employment discrimination against Aboriginal women and women belonging to minority groups can directly improve their living conditions.</p>
                                            <p>We can support specialized programs that target the aforementioned gaps in our social safety net. Spreading awareness about the scope of the problem is itself a critical step toward helping Canadian women move out of poverty.</p>

                    <section class="wrapper--inner wrapper--main-file cf">
                        <p>While new legislation and strategic initiatives in the postwar period undoubtedly helped to improve the position of women in Canadian society, a closer examination reveals persistent problems in many areas of economic life.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Under-representation in management roles.</span> The proportion of women in senior management positions has virtually flatlined over the past two decades or so, even though there has been a steady increase in overall female labour-force participation. Since 1987, men have been two to three times more likely than women to be senior managers, and one-and-a-half times more likely to be middle managers. Contrary to popular assumptions, women have not made significant progress toward gender equality at the middle-management level in either the private or public sector. After decades of striving for equality, women still have not reached the executive level in organizations at the rates once predicted, despite early assurances that time would remedy the disparity. The few women who do become top managers often attract media scrutiny, which may create a false sense that barriers to women&rsquo;s advancement no longer exist (The Conference Board of Canada, 2011).</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Part-time work.</span> Women constitute a large proportion of the part-time workforce, and as such, usually earn less and therefore are particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. Seventy percent of all part-time workers are women. Over 20&#8239;percent of these women would take full-time employment if it was available.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Minimum-wage legislation.</span> Because women hold 64 percent of minimum-wage jobs, they are the group most in need of minimum-wage legislation. Providing a decent living wage for women could be a major step on the part of governments toward promoting greater wage equity and anti-poverty policy goals.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Maternity and parental leave.</span> Women still perform double duty: even if they work outside the home, they are most often the primary caregivers for dependent children and relatives, so that work-life balance continues to act as a major barrier for working women.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Dependent care.</span> Because women are most often the primary caregivers of dependent children, Canada&rsquo;s lack of universal child care programs is a significant barrier to women&rsquo;s full participation in the labour force. Daycare is a necessity for many employed mothers.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Free trade and globalization.</span> These global trends, involving competition from cheap labour markets overseas, particularly affect women who find themselves in low-wage jobs.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Pension programs.</span> These programs are of special significance to women because women are often employed in jobs that do not give them access to private pension plans.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Recessions.</span> Economic downturns affect women disproportionately. Forty percent of employed women hold part-time, casual, or temporary jobs, which are the first to be cut during a recession.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Employment insurance programs.</span> Programs designed to assist workers can place women at a disadvantage. Increases in the required eligibility periods make it more difficult for women than men to collect Employment Insurance; for example, women who work part-time because they care for children may not have worked enough hours to qualify for EI.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In short, despite all the changes in the areas of pay equity and employment equity, the problems Canadian women face in (and out) of the labour market are widespread and persistent. The stress resulting from these inequalities takes a toll on women and their families, and social workers are often called upon first to deal with the unfortunate consequences.</p>

                                           <p>Child-care fees across the country are high and getting higher, particularly in Toronto, and advocates say the federal government should take action to lessen the burden on families that are struggling to cover the costs.</p>

                                           <p>A new study from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives finds that child-care costs are highest in Toronto, where the median monthly cost of full-day care for an infant is $1,736.</p>

                                           <p>The increasing fees are tantamount to “a second mortgage,” said Carolyn Ferns, public policy coordinator with the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care. “It’s something that I don’t think we can afford to ignore anymore.”</p>

                                           <p>For a child between the ages of one-and-a-half and three, the median monthly cost of care is $1,325; parents of children aged three to five can expect to pay $1,033 for a month of care, according to the study.</p>

                                           <p>Adjusting for inflation and using federal data from 2010 for families in which the youngest child is under six, the CCPC says a Toronto family with a median income can expect to spend 48 percent of their after-tax income to pay for a year of child care for two children.</p>

                                           <p>Subsidies for low-income families can render expensive child care affordable—at least in theory.</p>

                                           <p>“Once subsidies are counted, the cities in Ontario where child care would otherwise be most expensive become the least expensive, with fees of $87 a month,” the authors write.</p>

                                           <p>The catch, co-author David Macdonald said, is that a family’s eligibility for a subsidy does not guarantee that they will receive it.</p>

                                           <p>The <i>Star</i> has reported that there are roughly 17,000 children waiting for child-care subsidies in Toronto. And proving eligibility can be an onerous task, Macdonald says, that guarantees you nothing but a spot in line behind 17,000 others.</p>

                                           <p>Not only are spaces scarce, but fees are climbing, as well.</p>

                                           <p>The study, which focused on licensed child care, found that “fees have increased by five percent [per year] on average,” well above the rate of inflation. In Toronto, monthly fees have jumped by $56 since last year, the largest cash spike in Canada.</p>

                                           <p>Kitchener and Windsor saw three-percent decreases in monthly fees, the study notes.</p>

                                           <p>For Safra Najeemudeen, a Ryerson graduate student in Markham, child-care costs are a fact of life, like paying rent.</p>

                                           <p>“You just have to suck it up,” said Najeemudeen, a mother of two. “And whatever it is, you just have to live with it.”</p>

                                           <p>Najeemudeen’s children attend child care before and after school at Mt. Joy Public School. The cost for each child is around $375, Najeemudeen said.</p>

                                           <p>Najeemudeen believes a cultural shift is necessary so that people view raising children as a societal responsibility and not an individual one.</p>

                                           <p>“Eventually, [our children] are going to support the entire society,” Najeemudeen said. “The main thing is...how children are viewed and how they’re not valued in society.”</p>

                                           <p>The study also highlights the low pay among child-care workers. Low wages for workers, high fees for parents, and the irrefutably high cost of providing child care point to a need for greater government involvement, Ferns said.</p>

                                           <p>“If you’re going to pay the workforce decently, and you’re going to have affordability for parents, right, we need to have more government intervention. We need to have more government funding to child care,” Ferns said.</p>

                                           <p>“That appears to be the most effective way of reducing fees,” said Macdonald, who believes a similar plan nationwide would keep fees low. “What it means, in essence...is that it’s only really in Québec that parents can afford to raise children.”</p>

                                           <p>Québec has recently changed its child-care system to charge families according to their income.</p>

                                           <p>The study suggests “federal coordination and funding” would lower costs and increase availability. Martha Friendly, executive director of the Child-care Resource and Research Unit, believes the government’s role should be a nuanced one.</p>

                                           <p>“What we need is more money. We also need more policy,” said Friendly, who co-authored the CCPC’s 2014 study on child care. “It’s not just producing more shoes. It’s a social program that has a lot of components.”</p>

                                           <p>This includes answering questions about staffing and maintaining good quality, Friendly said.</p>

                                           <p>“The lack of policy driving even the money that there is makes it inefficient,” Friendly said. “It’s in fits and starts and, we always say, a patchwork.”</p>

                        <p>Sexual violence is a major social problem in Canada today. Indeed, the level of violence against women, in whatever form it takes, is one of the strongest indicators of prevailing societal attitudes toward women.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-12">Sexual assault</span> is any form of unwanted sexual activity, including fondling, touching, and penetration, that is forced upon another person without that person&rsquo;s consent. It includes a wide range of criminal acts ranging from rape to sexual harassment. All forms of sexual assault are crimes under the Criminal Code. Lack of consent is a key component of defining an act as sexual assault. Consent is an active choice and the voluntary agreement of adults to engage in sexual activity. Someone who is under the influence of medication, drugs, or alcohol is not considered to be in the position to give consent (Status of Women, 2002: 19).</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-13">Sexual harassment</span> is any unwanted behaviour, comment, gesture, or contact of a sexual nature that treats the person receiving it as a sexual object.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Women make up the majority of victims of sexual assault (92 percent) and other types of sexual offences (Statistics Canada, 2008). However, most sexual assaults are not reported, either because women feel afraid, don&rsquo;t want to go to court, or know that the probability of conviction is low.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Aftermath of Sexual Assault: How Social Workers Can Help</p>
                        <p>Many sexual assaults occur when women are on a date. In fact, acquaintance sexual assault accounted for 45 percent of reported cases in 2007. The perpetrators were current or former partners, friends, or acquaintances. In addition, 37 percent of sexual assaults on women were perpetrated by a family member or an authority figure).</p>
                        <p>Women who are assaulted by someone they know often struggle with trusting others and with trusting their own ability to stay safe and make good decisions. They may also struggle with blaming themselves, even if they know that the assault was not their fault. The recovery process can be more complicated when the assailant is known to the victim. It is important for social workers to be aware that this type of assault is common and can happen to anyone.</p>
                        <p>Recovering from a sexual assault can be a long and painful process. Women often feel as though they should have done more to prevent the situation, and they may be worried that people will not believe them. Many women seek support to help them deal with ongoing nightmares, distrust, fear, anxiety, fatigue, difficulties with sex, depression, guilt, and shame&mdash;and social workers are often the professionals to whom these women turn.</p>
                        <p>Social workers play an important role in sexual assault crisis centres, sexual assault helplines, sexual assault and domestic violence care and treatment centres, sexual assault survivor centres, and shelters or transition houses (see Figure 8.1). They arrange counselling, legal, and medical services that victims and survivors might need. They sometimes accompany women to the hospital, to the police, and through court proceedings, as well as to appointments with lawyers and financial aid workers, providing emotional support and advocacy.</p>
                        <p>In addition to providing counselling and other types of support, social workers educate the public about sexual violence, advocate for women, and campaign for policy and systemic change. Social workers in this field recognize that sexual violence is not only an individual problem, but also reflects wider societal and structural problems.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">According to Canadian law, sexual consent should be both positive (e.g., saying “yes,” initiating and/or enjoying sexual activity) and ongoing (i.e., continues during sexual activity).

                        <p>The results of a study by the Canadian Women&rsquo;s Foundation revealed that the definition of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-14">consent</span> can become blurred when it comes to new versus existing partners and online versus offline sexual activity (Canadian Women&rsquo;s Foundation, 2015). The study revealed that</p>
                        
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">almost all Canadians (96 percent) believe all sexual activities should be consensual, yet only one in three Canadians understand what it means to give consent; and that</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">one in ten Canadians believe consent to sexual activity is not needed between long-term partners and spouses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>&ldquo;Over the past year, sexual assault has been pushed into the spotlight, causing greater awareness about the importance of consent,&rdquo; says Anuradha Dugal, Director of Violence Prevention at the Canadian Women&rsquo;s Foundation. &ldquo;The fact that most Canadians agree sexual activity should be consensual is a positive sign that people understand the critical importance of consent. However, it&rsquo;s alarming that so many people don&rsquo;t understand what consent actually looks like. This gap can increase the risk of unwanted sexual activity and assault, and is a clear sign that Canadians desperately need more education on the meaning of consent.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The survey also showed that many young Canadians have a blurred understanding of consent when technology is involved. One in five (21 percent) people aged 18 to 34 believe if a woman sends a man an explicit photo via text or email, this always means she is inviting him to engage in offline sexual activity. According to Dugal, &ldquo;As we embrace the digital age, it is important that younger Canadians fully understand the meaning of consent and how it applies in both online and in-person settings.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>The role of social workers in helping women who are survivors of abuse may include crisis intervention, emotional support, empowerment, support group facilitation, and the provision of information. A social worker in a shelter will frequently be the first person a woman meets after she leaves a violent situation. At this critical time, it may be necessary for the social worker to explain the cycle of violence and emphasize that the abuse is likely to occur again. The social work process will be aided by conveying the message that the abuse is not the woman&rsquo;s fault and that she is not the only woman to have experienced this kind of trauma.</p>

While it may be difficult for a social worker to see a woman go back to an abusive relationship (sometimes several times), the worker must be sure not to take the power of decision making away from the woman.</p>
                        <p>In all such situations, the first priority is the safety of the woman. Within this context, the social worker may partake in one or several of the following activities:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Intervene in a crisis, which may involve the identification and assessment of danger to the woman and perhaps her children.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Facilitate an empowerment approach with the woman.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Listen to what the woman has to say and empathetically respond, sharing one&rsquo;s personal experience if appropriate.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Connect the woman to a support group of individuals who have had a common experience.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Make an appropriate referral if, for example, the woman has immediate financial needs.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Advise the woman of her legal rights and link her to appropriate legal resources, in the event that she decides to press charges and appear as a witness in a criminal court.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Mobilize safety, legal, and community resources effectively (e.g., linking children to a protective service, arranging admission to a shelter for abused women, finding a translator, or linking a sexual assault victim with an advocate).</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Implement agency policies regarding documentation and keep accurate records, including dental and other X-rays, as these may aid later legal action (if a woman decides to pursue such action).</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">When writing case notes, be careful not to record anything that might be misinterpreted or used against a victim if her records are subpoenaed by a defence lawyer.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Use the consultative process (know whom to call under what circumstances, and do it) and review one&rsquo;s referrals and interventions with other health-care providers.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Complete the crisis management and follow-up referral or treatment steps while withholding judgement or imposing values on the woman and her significant others.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Provide full follow-up and counselling with the woman to help prevent the onset of isolation and depression&mdash;these are risks for survivors of abuse or sexual assault.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Again, in carrying out these activities, the social worker should ensure that the woman feels empowered to make important decisions about her own life. Moving forward, a social worker can help a woman recognize abuse, name the problem and its source, and avoid self-blame. A social worker can also help a woman who is at risk of further violence to assess the assault/homicide potential in domestic and other situations, and take appropriate action.</p>

                                            <p>The Women’s Centre of Calgary is every woman’s place for support, connections, and community. It is a street-level storefront, an accessible gathering spot for all women. The heart of the Women’s Centre is a large open room with comfortable seating and a welcoming atmosphere. Women can simply drop by for a cup of coffee, talk with other women, and seek help for any concern they might have.</p>
                                            <p>The Women’s Centre is a place where women from all walks of life can feel safe to get and to give help, without time restrictions, cost, or judgment. Services include peer support, information and referrals, legal advice, discussion groups, workshops, basic needs assistance, and access to computers and other equipment.</p>
                                            <p>The work of the Women’s Centre is founded on a peer-support model of service delivery, whereby women are supported and trained to help other women. This means that all services are provided by and for women, with the backup and support of staff. As women talk, work, and help each other at the Centre, it is often difficult to distinguish between service user, volunteer, and staff member. The peer-support model also reflects a feminist, anti-oppressive, strengths-based, and community development approach.</p>
                                            <p>The Centre works to recruit a diverse base of staff and volunteers, conduct ongoing diversity training, and develop inclusive policies and practices. Programs are based on the requests of women who use the Centre, and deliberate efforts are made to offer programs that will engage a wide range of women, as well as promote their participation in the community and their involvement in issues that affect them. There are community groups for women with disabilities, English practice groups, and after-school programs and camps for girls. The Centre participates in coalitions, organizes community events, and contributes to social action initiatives.</p>
                                            <p>While the Centre does not keep individual client files, it does keep track of program contacts, and it aims to assess its work in various ways, such as through focus groups and surveys. For example, one survey found that 88 percent of women that come to the Centre reported they experience inclusion, finding someone to talk to at the Women’s Centre.</p>
                                            <p>“I feel like I belong to a strong community. I’ve been able to meet many women from different walks of life,” one woman&#160;explained.</p>
                                            <p>The Centre strives to ensure that women’s voices are present in dialogues around various social, political, and economic issues. They work for change by spreading awareness and focusing on critical issues that matter to women. Women have the opportunity to become involved in the Social Issues Committee and the Social Policy Committee where they can discuss issues affecting women in Calgary. Each month, the Social Issues Committee holds a discussion night and invites community partners to present on topics of interest. Women are then encouraged to collaborate and brainstorm how they can create change in their communities. The Social Policy Committee works to contribute a gendered lens to policy by partnering with other non-profit organizations and coalitions to strategically influence policy change at the municipal and provincial levels. The Social Policy Committee is currently focused on the issues of poverty, child care, income, transportation, and women’s leadership.</p>
                                            <p>With incredible support from the community, funding, and over 690 volunteers and 14 staff, the Women’s Centre continues to be a place for support, connections, and community for thousands of women. As one woman said, “Sometimes I feel like the Centre is my second home.”</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Seeking an understanding of intimate partner abuse and how to prevent it</p>
                                            <p>It was not until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that women were recognized as having legal and political rights. With respect to domestic violence, however, what happened behind closed doors was considered to be no one else’s business. Police were reluctant to respond to domestic disputes, and the courts did not take such matters seriously. In fact, the prevailing view was that men should have complete authority in the home, and this view met with general acceptance. Insofar as they were financially dependant on their husbands, many women historically had little recourse if their husbands became abusive.</p>
                                            <p>As a result, most assaults on women were not reported to the authorities. But in the 1980s, mandatory charging by police against accused assailants took effect across Canada. Formal training was established to assist police officers in determining a proper course of action when responding to domestic disputes, as well as to help them recognize chargeable assaults.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold"><span>Findings of Victimization Surveys</span></p>
                                            <p>Many social workers take exception to the phrases “family violence” and “domestic violence.” They believe that these generalized terms gloss over the reality that it is usually men who are violent against women. The facts are certainly clear.</p>
                                            <p>According to a Statistics Canada report containing police-reported data for 2010, there were almost 99,000 victims of family violence that year, accounting for one quarter (25&#160;percent) of all victims of violent crime (Sinha. 2010). Almost an equal proportion of these victims were spouses (49&#160;percent) or other family members, such as children, parents, siblings, or extended family members (51 percent).</p>
                                            <p>Unlike for other forms of violent crime, females had more than double the risk of males of becoming a victim of police-reported family violence (407 victims per 100,000 people versus 180 victims per 100,000). This increased risk was primarily attributed to females’ higher representation as victims of spousal violence.</p>
                                            <p>In 2010, there were over 102,500 victims of intimate partner violence, including spousal and dating violence. This translates into a rate of 363 per 100,000 people aged 15 years and older and was almost 2.5 times higher than the rate recorded for family violence against a child, parent, or other family member (150 victims per 100,000).</p>
                                            <p>A victimization survey carried out in 2003 by the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics aligns with these facts. At the time, Canada had 606 victim service agencies: 41 percent were police-based, 19 percent were community-based, 17&#160;percent were sexual assault centre-based, 10&#160;percent were court-based, and 8 percent were system-based.</p>
                                            <p>A survey conducted on one day in 2003 demonstrated that over 75 percent of the individuals who sought help from these agencies were victims of violent crime, and the majority were female. In fact, of the 4400 individuals helped on the day of the survey, almost three quarters were women or girls.</p>
                                            <p>Even when sexual assault centres are removed from the total, women seeking assistance still represent 70 percent of those who seek help. And of the 4400 individuals surveyed, more than 1300 females were victims of violence by a spouse, an ex-spouse, or an intimate partner.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">Theorizing Violence against Women</p>
                                            <p>Violence against a woman by a man is a social act, a behaviour for which the perpetrator is accountable to the community. A variety of theories have been advanced to explain why this phenomenon occurs in Canadian society. Each of these attempts to conceptualize violence against women contains a great deal of truth. Below are four of them.</p>
                                            
                                            <ul class="ul--list">
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-15">Power Theory.</span> This theory argues that violence against women is a societal problem which occurs mainly because of the power imbalance between men and women, and more specifically because of the dominance of men and traditional male roles. The violence has continued because there has been historical acceptance of men’s right to control women, even by force. Those who hold this theory emphasize that society must change its attitudes, values, and responses with respect to women if violence against women is to be eliminated. This theory is consistent with a structural or feminist approach to social work.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-16">Learning Theory.</span>The main idea behind this theory is that violence is a behaviour learned in childhood. Boys learn that it is okay to be violent, and girls learn that is it okay to be on the receiving end of violence and that this is what relationships are about. This theory holds that all children in our society are socialized to accept violence and that this, coupled with other roles into which boys and girls are socialized, supports <a href="#" id="page-261" class="ch-link">and perpetuates abuse. Accordingly, children who witness violence in the home are much more likely to become abusers or be abused. The emphasis of this theory is on changing behaviour through education and counselling.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red">Anger-Control Theory.</span>This theory emphasizes that men must be held accountable for their violent behaviour. That is, they must learn to deal with and control their anger or suffer the consequences. This theory does not attempt to explain the root cause of violence against women, and in this respect, is different from the two theories above. Instead, it focuses on anger control—if men can learn to control their anger, violence will stop. This is a behaviourial change model. Those who hold to this theory tend to favour a criminalization and punishment-based social work approach.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-18">Cycle-of-Violence Theory.</span>This theory also avoids trying to explain why violence occurs; rather, it uses a three-step process to describe what happens in individual relationships.
                                                    <ul class="ul--list">
                                                        <li class="li--bullet-item">The first phase is the tension-building phase. In this phase, the woman sees that tension is building in the relationship and that there is going to be an explosion. The man is expressing more anger every day. He may be kicking the dog or yelling at the children.</li>
                                                        <li class="li--bullet-item">The second phase involves an acute battering incident. The tension reaches a point where the man becomes physically violent toward the woman. She may be verbally abused as well as hit, bruised, and battered. This is usually a shorter phase than the first, lasting between two and twenty-four hours.</li>
                                                        <li class="li--bullet-item">The third phase is called the honeymoon period. In this phase, the man says he is sorry; he should not have done it; he loves her; he begs her not to leave him; he promises it will never happen again. The man calls relatives to ask them to convince the woman to return to him. If the woman has left during the second phase, she might return to him during this phase. Statistics show that a woman is usually abused and leaves many times before she leaves for the final time. Women want to believe that their partner has changed; they may also feel that it will be their fault if the marriage breaks down, as they perhaps didn’t work hard enough at the relationship. Some women stay for the sake of the children or believe that a bad marriage is better than no marriage at all.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>These four theories draw attention to different aspects of the problem of violence against women. Any social work assessment of a situation of violence enacted by a man against a woman needs to consider these major theories.</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Different ways of seeing women’s experiences and gender-based power relations&#173;</p>
                                            <p>Social work, like many other fields of study and practice, was greatly influenced by the women’s movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Students demanded that social work schools look more critically at social problems and develop programs that would be more responsive to women’s issues.</p>
                                            <p>Feminist theories offered different ways of seeing and understanding women’s experiences, the nature of sexual inequality, and gender relations. Women’s consciousness-raising groups began to question gender-based roles and power relations in society. By sharing experiences, women began to understand that their own experiences were not unique.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">Incorporating Feminist Principles</p>
                                            <p>Incorporating feminist principles into one’s social work practice is a challenging and ongoing commitment. It should go without saying that it is important to value women’s experiences and identities, and to recognize that women have been subjected to negative stereotypes. Social workers who incorporate these principles value the diverse experiences of all their clients.</p>
                                            <p>Social work practice informed by feminist principles requires an awareness of power differences and how they affect both the therapeutic relationship and the client’s life. While a client is recounting a bad experience, the worker may ask, “How do you think this experience relates to your gender?” or “How is your situation similar to that of other women?” Identifying and critically analyzing behaviours, rather than labelling them as “bad,” helps women move from feelings of powerlessness and helplessness to confidence and determination. Focusing on the client’s skills, agency, and resilience fosters self-esteem, as well as a healthy and egalitarian client–therapist relationship.</p>
                                            <p>Giving voice to her experiences, especially those involving trauma, can be an important first step in a client’s healing process. Listening and validating are therefore two of the most important aspects of applying feminist principles to social work practice. When appropriate, worker self-disclosure can bring comfort, validation, and a sense of connection, as it can help a client recognize that there are others who have faced similar challenges. It can also help her differentiate between individual and social problems and let go of self-blame. Worker self-disclosure can foster trust and egalitarianism.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">The Components of Feminist Social Work Practice</p>
                                            <p>There are numerous formulations and debates within feminist theory. There is, however, a core belief that social structures and gender stereotypes perpetuate women’s subordination. Fundamentally, many feminist principles and concepts are similar to those of social work practice, such as empowerment and examining society through a critical lens.</p>
                                            <p>In her 1995 book<span> Feminist Practice in the 21st Century</span>,Helen Land, a University of Southern California professor and accomplished feminist clinical practitioner, outlines the following thirteen components of feminist social work practice:</p>
                                            <ul class="ul--list">
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Validating the social context.</span> Feminist approaches emphasize the effect of social context or structures on the client, and the client and the worker assess them jointly.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Re-valuing positions enacted by women. </span>Social workers see the activities and stances ascribed to women, such as nurturing, cooperating, and caregiving, as important and valuable. Society and mainstream psychotherapies, however, typically assign more importance to behaviours and values ascribed to men, such as competition and upward mobility.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Recognizing differences in men’s and women’s experiences. </span>Feminist social workers maintain that mainstream social theories ignore women’s experiences. To understand the emotional worlds of women, social workers must understand how the oppressive structures in society affect women.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Readusting perceptions of normality and deviance. </span>The need to readjust perceptions of normality refers to the fact that what is considered abnormal or dysfunctional is simply less common (or very common, but only within marginalized groups). For example, feminine behaviour, such as expressing emotion, is seen as weak or abnormal when exhibited by men. Similar attitudes exist about behaviour that is common among racialized groups and LGBTQ+ communities.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Taking an inclusive stance. </span>This requires social workers to challenge narrow assumptions—their own and others’— and to respect and affirm the experiences and values of clients from diverse communities.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Heeding power dynamics in the client–worker relationship. </span>This aspect ensures that the social worker develops professional, egalitarian relationships with clients<span>. It also fosters a client’s comfort, trust, and sense of empowerment.</span></li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold"><a href="#" id="page-263" class="ch-link">Recognizing how “the personal is political.” </a></span>This component acknowledges that personal difficulties faced by clients may reflect historical and political contexts, such as displacement and immigration. Such wider systems and ideologies influence how we think, feel, and experience events.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Taking a deconstructive stance. </span>The deconstructive stance attempts to uncover and examine how patriarchal social relations support and perpetuate a male-dominated world. The feminist approach therefore continually questions commonplace notions of what is “right” and “wrong,” “normal” and “abnormal.”</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Taking a partnering stance.</span> This refers to the belief that disclosure of personal experiences by a social worker can be helpful to a client, especially if common experiences are apparent. This practice is quite contrary to traditional psychotherapy, which holds that professional distance between therapist and <span>client is required.</span></li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Fostering inclusive scholarship.</span> In challenging the traditional notions of objective science, feminist scholarship frequently emphasizes both qualitative research methods (such as interviews or case studies) and quantitative methods (such as numerical frequencies and statistics). It also stresses centering on women’s real-life experiences rather than on abstract theoretical models that claim to represent reality.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Challenging reductionist models.</span> Reductionism refers to the practice of reducing behaviours to simple cause-and-effect models, which often amount to stereotypes and which can severely limit one’s ability to understand complex issues. For example, there is a stereotype of women as being naturally more emotional, and men as being more objective. Feminist social workers resoundingly challenge such views.</li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Adopting empowerment practice. </span>Empowerment practice means that the worker and the client develop goals together, with a focus on empowering the client to change his or her structures and environments, rather than on helping the client adapt to and <span>cope with existing oppressive structures.</span></li>
                                                <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Countering the myth of neutral psychotherapy.</span> In general, feminist social workers reject the idea that a person can be neutral or value-free in their practice, and believe that workers must be explicit about their own biases and values. They also assist clients in discovering and taking ownership of beliefs and values.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>These thirteen components offer a framework for understanding women’s experiences and can help social workers support women through difficult times. These components seek to challenge wider structures and policies that foster gender inequality. Indeed, they are so important that they are becoming an accepted part of standard social work practice.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold-grey text--bold">Can Male Social Work Practitioners Adopt Feminist&#160;Principles?</p>
                                            <p>There are obviously many occasions when it is only appropriate that a female worker, rather than a male, support a woman in need. This is the case, for example, when working with women who have been sexually abused or raped, where the presence of a male social worker would be clearly inappropriate. It is widely recognized that women should counsel such individuals. This work normally takes place in settings such as rape crisis centres and women’s shelters, where experienced staff members are trained to deal with emergency situations and to provide support and assistance.</p>
                                            <p>However, male social workers can, should, and do incorporate feminist principles into their practice. Male practitioners working with the New Directions program in Ottawa, for example, use feminist principles when working with men who have abused women.</p>
                                            <p>The program teaches men to take responsibility for their abusive behaviour and helps them see their behaviour within the wider social context of a male-dominated society. The history of abuse that many of the men themselves may have experienced is also addressed, and common experiences between the men are explored.</p>

                        <p>Part of addressing intimate partner violence involves working with men who perpetrate the abuse. There are different approaches to working with men who use violence against women. One approach is restorative justice, in which a woman who has experienced abuse is invited to define what justice means to her, in this context. The rehabilitation process, therefore, is largely guided by the needs and perspectives of the person (or persons) affected by the partner&rsquo;s abusive behaviour. The process also involves the partner and the wider community in addressing these actions to restore the woman&rsquo;s sense of safety, respect, and integrity. The restorative justice process may or may not involve either restoring intimate relationships or arranging a face-to-face meeting with a woman and a partner.</p>
                        <p>The Bridges Institute in Nova Scotia is an organization that works with men and their families to stop abuse and build respectful relationships. Bridges integrates narrative therapy and restorative justice. Tod Augusta-Scott, a social worker and the executive director of the Bridges Institute, has identified several components in the therapeutic process whereby men take responsibility for the violence they have used against their female partners:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Exploring values and ethics:</span> Exploring the values and ethics that men deem important includes identifying what men perceive as important in relationships and in how they conduct their lives: respect, trust, safety, equality, taking responsibility, and accountability.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Studying the abuse:</span> Men study their own escalation and warning signs, and learn how doing so might prevent violence from happening in the future.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Studying the full effects of the abuse:</span> The goal is to prevent abuse from happening again.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Healing and repair:</span> Men come to understand how to heal and repair the effects of their abuse on their female partners, their children, and the wider community.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">How the Restorative Justice Process Unfolds</p>
                        <p>Restorative justice does not involve a predictable approach but is based, rather, on the unique circumstances of each case. All men and women begin the process by meeting first with their own social worker, largely to determine issues of safety. A woman may choose to have no further contact with her partner. Many women, however, want to see clear evidence that the men who hurt them are learning to become accountable for their actions. Even women who wish to separate from their partners often want to see these men accept responsibility for their behaviour. Many of these women still have contact with their former partners because they live in the same community, have children together, or simply do not want their former partners to hurt other women. Women who do not wish further contact but who are invested in their former partner taking responsibility can still communicate what they want through counsellors or video-conferencing. Some women choose to speak with their partners or former partners directly in the controlled setting of a counselling office. These conjoint conversations hinge on issues of safety as assessed by the woman herself and by the social workers involved. The man is also offered an opportunity to take responsibility for his behaviour by attending group, family, and conjoint sessions if all involved decide that the conditions are safe.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold">A couple damaged by the man&rsquo;s violence is guided by social workers in a restorative justice process to help regain dignity, equality, respect, and harmony in the relationship.</p>
                            <p>Susan and Wade have been yelling and swearing at each other in front of their children. When Wade pushed Susan, she called 911. The police arrived, charged Wade with assault, and removed him from the home. Child Protection Services became involved and insisted that Wade not return home. Wade and Susan are referred to the Bridges Institute, an organization that works with men and their families to stop abuse and build respectful relationships. Wade is mandated to attend counselling, while Susan&rsquo;s involvement is voluntary.</p>
                            <p>Susan and Wade each see their own social worker. With the couple&rsquo;s permission, the two social workers maintain contact with each other to monitor safety. The social worker who is seeing Susan adopts a therapeutic stance rather than making assumptions about her. Using a restorative justice approach, the social worker invites Susan to define what &ldquo;justice&rdquo; means to her. Susan defines both the effects of the abuse and what she wants from Wade and others so that she can start healing from the effects of domestic violence.</p>
                            <p>Susan reports that she loves Wade and wants to stay with him. She says that justice will be served when Wade stops his abuse and repairs the harm he has done. She wants Wade to treat her and the children with respect, and she wishes to feel safe. She would like Wade to repair the holes in the walls that he made when he lost his temper. She wants him to apologize to her parents for hurting their daughter and grandchildren. And she wants him to tell the children that inflicting violence on others is wrong.</p>
                            <p>Besides seeing a social worker on her own, Susan states that she wants to join a support group for women as well as attend counselling sessions with Wade. Susan says she wants the counsellor&rsquo;s support to tell Wade what the effects of the abuse have been and what she thinks he can do about repairing the damage. The social worker asks whether Susan would feel safe speaking freely with Wade in the room. Susan replies that she would feel safe. The social worker assesses the possible influence of dominant gender expectations on Susan, and considers whether Susan is prioritizing her own safety over comforting Wade. The social worker decides that Susan seems empowered and clear enough about her decision to recommend it as a possibility to the social worker who is working with Wade.</p>
                            <p>In a meeting with Wade, the social worker does not assume that Wade wants only power and control in his relationship with Susan. The worker is open to the possibility that Wade may also want mutual love, trust, respect, and safety in his family. The social worker engages Wade collaboratively by asking him to define his values and the type of relationship he wishes to have. The worker and Wade discuss values such as mutual respect, equality, safety, and responsibility. The social worker assesses whether Wade is willing to take responsibility for stopping his abuse by studying past incidents. By doing this, Wade can begin to spot the warning signs that precede his abusive outbursts and identify how he can prevent the escalation of violence by reminding himself of his values. The social worker invites Wade to consider the benefits of studying the effects of his abuse and how it might help him heal and repair those effects.</p>
                            <p>After several sessions together, Wade and his social worker determine that he is ready to take responsibility for his abusive behaviour in the next counselling session. Wade begins the process of openly studying and acknowledging his escalation toward violence. During a joint counselling session with Susan, Susan observes Wade becoming more accountable to her, and she witnesses his commitment to stop his abusive behaviour. Because she sees him taking the issue seriously, he begins to regain her trust. She decides that she wants to tell him the warning signs she notices that precede his abusive behaviour. She tells him how the abuse has affected her and what she wants him to do to address these effects. After three sessions over a five-week period, Susan reports that she feels more acknowledged, respected, and secure in Wade&rsquo;s commitment to repairing their relationship. The couple decide that they also want to focus on repairing the effects that Wade&rsquo;s abuse have had on Susan&rsquo;s parents. And finally, Wade decides that he wants to join a men&rsquo;s group to support the changes he is making.</p>

                        <p>Each province and territory has a unique array of services dedicated to responding to the abuse of women. These services include transition houses and shelters, second-stage housing, safe houses, and family resource centres, all of which have varied funding arrangements and availability. They are all residential, meaning that they provide food and shelter for abused women and their children as required.</p>
                        <p>Transition houses are responsive to the needs of abused women and their children, are sensitive to the power relations within traditional family structures, and emphasize social change. Because of their success, the number of transition houses and shelters is growing. While they are becoming an increasingly important primary resource for women and their children, they also face serious funding problems.</p>
                        <p>In the 1970s, the women&rsquo;s movement struggled hard for the funding and development of shelters. Today they are the foremost resource for protecting assaulted women from violent partners and assisting women in moving on with their lives. An effective shelter provides the following kinds of services:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">emergency access to a safe place (including emergency transportation and overnight accommodation, particularly for those in rural and isolated areas)</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item">access to affordable and safe housing, and to legal and medical services</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Other available services may also include a crisis telephone line, crisis intervention, advocacy, and children&rsquo;s programs. Some centres provide former residents and non-residents with newsletters, walk-in services, or support groups.</p>
                        <p>As the next story shows, support groups are a key component of social work with women seeking to leave abusive relationships. They can support women in a number of ways: they help reduce isolation and allow women to meet others who share their experiences; they help women develop an understanding of issues of power and control and what actions they can take to change difficult situations; they can be a forum for women to exchange information, practical help, and emotional support; and finally, they allow women to explore their self-image and appreciate their strengths and accomplishments.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p><em>Supported by social workers experienced in counselling women who have been physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by a partner, Marla found the strength to set out on a new life path for herself and her children.</em></p>
                            <p>My name is Marla. I want to share my personal experience as a survivor of intimate partner violence.</p>
                            <p>Over 20 years ago, I started suffering severe asthma attacks. At the time, I had six children ranging from 3 to 13 years of age, and I was working full-time in a hospital as a medical laboratory technologist. Needless to say, I was under a lot of stress. What wasn&rsquo;t so obvious to me was the secret stress that I couldn&rsquo;t even admit to myself: that I was being physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by my husband. My marriage was important to me, but the abuse was definitely taking its toll.</p>
                            <p>I thought back then that my husband had an excuse for his behaviour: he was struggling with the effects of alcohol addiction. And I loved him. I was married for 16 years before I separated from my husband.</p>
                            <p>Choosing to leave and then finally separating from my spouse was a very long and dangerous journey. I had endured years of abuse. I had also remained silent to ensure that my children would continue to love their father. But after repeated hospitalizations to treat my asthma attacks, I took the advice of a physician who said I needed help on an emotional level. My parish priest gave me the phone number for Catholic Family Services and suggested that I might wish to talk to someone there.</p>
                            <p>With the support of social workers at Catholic Family Services, I learned how to handle the unbelievable stress of being threatened, stalked, and deprived of funds by my estranged spouse, and I learned how to protect my children and myself from the man I loved. I learned how to organize and execute an escape plan, to keep clothes and supplies on hand in case we had to run, and to find safe houses where we could hide. I also learned how to enlist the help of schools and the police. All of these lessons were critical to our survival.</p>
                            <p>In order to keep my family under one roof, I began working 12-hour shifts at the hospital, including nights. Most mornings I would return home after working a night shift and care for the younger children while the older ones were at school. As a result, I became chronically over-tired, which sometimes landed me in the hospital.</p>
                            <p>Individual therapy, both for my children and myself, as well as my own group therapy with other women, were key to our survival. Through group counselling with other survivors, I learned that I was not alone. There was so much support provided by other women that a Sistering Program was developed at Catholic Family Services. This volunteer program for women who have experienced violence, trauma, or other forms of oppression began with seven women volunteers who were themselves survivors and who had moved forward in their healing journey. Therapists matched newcomers with women who were just beginning to make changes in their lives, and the newcomers benefitted from witnessing the healing process taking place in the lives of their &ldquo;sisters.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Without the support, guidance, and financial assistance provided by Share Life and Catholic Family Services, my story may have been very, very different. Many women never make it, and I could not have done this alone. Given my limited financial resources, I would never have been able to protect my children without help. I do owe Share Life and Catholic Family Services my life.</p>
                            <p>Learning to live again without the threat of abuse, being a witness to women&rsquo;s rights, feeling validated, and being free&mdash;that&rsquo;s what life means to me now. How different things might have been for all of us! After six years on my own with my children following my separation and divorce, I married a good man with two children of his own. Today I am a grandmother to 13 beautiful grandchildren.</p>
                            <p>Now more than 17 years old, the Sistering Program is flourishing, and it remains an important part of my life. I continue to be involved in counselling other women who are living in abusive relationships, where I share my personal story while my own healing journey continues.</p>

                        <p>Crisis-related services for victims of sexual assault include intervention and response, emergency crisis counselling, and crisis telephone-line assistance. Sexual assault crisis centres that function as community-based, non-profit agencies often have 24-hour crisis lines. Hospital-based sexual assault centres also have nurses and doctors on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week through emergency departments so that victims of sexual assault can receive specialized medical and emotional support services as soon as possible. Ontario also has a Victim Crisis Assistance and Referral Service (VCARS) made up of non-profit, community-based programs to provide on-scene, short-term support to help victims stabilize in the aftermath of an assault and to refer them to appropriate community services for long-term assistance.</p>
                        <p>Based on the 2011/2012 Victim Services in Canada survey, 76 percent of social service providers reported that they offer services to both urban and rural areas. Over half (57 percent) indicated that they service rural areas, and 24 percent reported that they service First Nations reserves (Allen, 2014).</p>
                        <p>At-risk rural women often face a unique set of challenges. These women may not have access to transportation or emergency shelters. Additionally, they may fear having their personal experiences revealed to others in close-knit communities, and protecting their children can also be more problematic in smaller communities. In the YMCA report <em>Life Beyond Shelte</em>r, one core recommendation highlights the need for ongoing and accessible transportation to help rural women benefit from available social services (YMCA Canada, 2009).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Crisis Intervention: The Front-Line Worker&rsquo;s Role</p>
                        <p>When a worker takes a call on a crisis line, the first step is to ascertain the caller&rsquo;s immediate safety. Crisis counselling also aims to open a conversation about treatment planning and intervention. In any subsequent face-to-face meetings between a worker and a client, creating a supportive atmosphere by fostering collaboration builds trust and and a sense of safety.</p>
                        <p>The primary goal of the social worker in responding to cases of sexual assault is to express belief in the survivor&rsquo;s story, listen attentively, and validate the woman&rsquo;s feelings and concerns. Compassion, empathy, and interpersonal sensitivity are some of the core traits that social workers often draw on in this type of counselling.</p>
                        <p>As seen in the next story, a worker may need to provide a follow-up referral to a specific agency, so knowledge of organizational networks that can offer support is crucial. For example, the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime (CRCVC), a federal non-profit organization, functions as a broker of services for victims and survivors of serious crime in Canada, including sexual assault. All services are bilingual, free of charge, confidential, and socially inclusive. The Centre offers links to a wide range of agencies and resources that provide counselling, as well as information about victims&rsquo; rights and services, women&rsquo;s shelters and transition houses, legal and financial help, and Internet and social media safety.</p>

                        </div>
                        <div class="grid--full cf">
                            <p class="text--bold">A 28-year-old woman named June calls the sexual assault crisis line in her community and tearfully informs the crisis line worker that her roommate&rsquo;s boyfriend has raped her. She also shares that she is a lesbian. June tells the worker that she is very worried about telling her roommate about the incident.</p>
                            <p>Having had specialized skills training in trauma counselling at the sexual assault crisis centre, the worker aims first of all to establish trust and respect between herself and the caller. Through active listening and validation, the worker strives to demonstrate compassion and a non-judgemental attitude in order to put June at ease, while creating a safe emotional space in which the worker can ask difficult yet important questions.</p>
                            <p>The worker begins by asking June about her immediate safety and well-being and her current location. June responds that she is alone at her cousin&rsquo;s house. June cannot stop crying and apologizes for her emotional state. Gently, the worker validates June&rsquo;s feelings by reassuring her that &ldquo;it is okay to cry and to be upset. You have experienced a very traumatic event, and I am here to help you get through this.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>The worker asks June about her health status and whether she has accessed a health centre or a hospital for medical treatment. These questions are posed because of the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and other physical injuries that June may have incurred during the incident. The worker offers to accompany June to the hospital if she wishes, and explains both the agency&rsquo;s protocol in dealing with cases of reported sexual assault and the services that the agency can provide to support individuals who have experienced a recent assault. It is essential that the worker offer to accompany June to the hospital, as nurses may sometimes contact the police about a sexual assault without informing the victim beforehand. Having a social worker present to advocate and intervene on the woman&rsquo;s behalf is critical.</p>
                            <p>The worker talks to June about the option of reporting the sexual assault to the police, and describes the specialized services available for survivors and families who do file a report. June seems hesitant about officially reporting her assault and says that she needs to think about this option.</p>
                            <p>Clearly distressed, June expresses bewilderment as to why she was sexually assaulted and blames herself for the incident. She expresses shame and embarrassment and questions how this experience will impact her identity as a woman and as a lesbian. Drawing on feminist concepts, the worker further validates June&rsquo;s feelings, reminding June that the person to be blamed is the man who sexually assaulted her and that June is in no way at fault for this man&rsquo;s violent actions.</p>
                            <p>June asks the worker whether she should tell her roommate about the incident. The worker carefully explores the implications, risks, and potential responses that June might encounter should she choose to confide in her roommate. The potential responses include disbelief, acceptance, or anger and potential tension in the relationship&mdash;and perhaps even the termination of the friendship. The worker reminds June that it is June&rsquo;s decision and no one else&rsquo;s as to whether she informs her roommate of what has occurred. This reminder is intended to help June regain a sense of power and control in the midst of a high-stress&#160;situation.</p>
                            <p>As they continue to talk, June wonders about how she will fare in the aftermath of the assault. The worker explains that June may have trouble sleeping, eating, and feeling safe. She will probably feel anxious and sad. At this point, the worker asks if June would like to learn about options for long-term crisis support services in the community. They discuss resources such as survivors&rsquo; support agencies, ongoing counselling services, and emotional support from family and friends. The worker asks if June&rsquo;s family is aware of her sexual orientation. June says that only her cousin is aware that she is gay. She also mentions that she has a strong connection to the LGBTQ+ community and expresses openness to accessing support through whatever LGBTQ+ community services might be available. The worker commends June for her willingness to reach out for help. She asks June what steps she would like to take next and what she thinks will work for her. As a first step, June books a face-to-face appointment with the worker for the next morning at the crisis counselling centre, with follow-up steps to be determined during the session.</p>

                            <p class="text--bold">Diana&rsquo;s work as a community development manager in Calgary, Alberta, has taught her to lead with curiosity and kindness, knowing that each individual is an expert in terms of his or her own experiences.</p>
                            <p>I began work at the Calgary Sexual Health Centre in 2007 as a community educator providing comprehensive sexuality education to junior-high and high-school students. Over time, my role has evolved into community facilitation on behalf of vulnerable youth and adult populations, including parents. I am now in a management position and am fortunate to work with dedicated, passionate, and feminist co-workers.</p>
                            <p>I completed a two-year degree in education at the University of Alberta and a two-year social work degree through Athabasca University. I am qualified as a registered social worker (RSW).</p>
                            <p>My journey in feminist practice was not planned. Early in my social work career, I was hired for an overnight position in a safe house for youth who had been sexually exploited and adults who needed a short-term respite from violence. My feminist perspective was shaped during those early days, as I encountered the powerful experiences of girls, women, trans women, and boys who were being victimized sexually. The realities of poverty, abuse in all its manifestations, addictions, violence, and the problems besetting First Nations peoples and women all collided, and I began to understand the interconnectedness of oppression and my role in it.</p>
                            <p>As a privileged, middle-class, white, able-bodied, cisgender woman, I have undergone a steep, terrifying, and ongoing learning curve. In the course of my work, my clients and colleagues have helped me understand my own experiences with sexual exploitation, addiction, unhealthy relationships, and patriarchal attitudes toward women.</p>
                            <p>At one point in my career, I became a doula and ran a pilot perinatal program to support young child-bearing women attempting to exit the sex trade. The barriers that these women faced from professionals and paraprofessionals in our health-care system were staggering. I am so grateful to those women who trusted me to be the best possible advocate for their reproductive rights. Not all of the outcomes were positive; some babies died, some were apprehended; some births were smooth and others complicated. These experiences taught me compassion and the fact that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity.</p>
                            <p>I also worked briefly with families and people with differing abilities in a HeadStart child-care program, where I witnessed the struggles of the working poor and single parents&mdash;mostly women&mdash;who were attempting to hold down jobs, go to school, and grapple with addictions and intimate partner violence while raising their children.</p>
                            <p>My path then led me to a group of ground-breaking women attempting to change community development in Edmonton, Alberta. I collaborated with this group, known as &ldquo;Success by 6,&rdquo; in developing a model in which one staff person from various organizations was seconded to work as part of a team of professionals to provide quick, nimble, community-driven supports for children and families. Team members had backgrounds in child welfare, health care, policing, and community mapping. The &ldquo;Success by 6&rdquo; team launched community initiatives related to early literacy and FASD (Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) and trained me for feminist practice. This group of women believed in the power of women&rsquo;s voices to speak out for themselves and their families. Eventually, the fatigue involved in continually justifying our existence and the loss of our champion to retirement led to the dismantling of our group, and I assumed my current role at the Calgary Sexual Health Centre.</p>
                            <p>Issues related to reproductive justice and women&rsquo;s rights over their own bodies inform the work that I do. A core understanding that society still wants to control, manipulate, and coerce women in the realms of sexuality, birth control, abortion, pregnancy, parenting, work, and gender drives me to continue to learn and unlearn what is understood to be healthy sexuality. Exploring healthy sexuality in all its nuances and intersections with oppression, and working with people from all walks of life across the lifespan and in ways I could never have imagined&mdash;these experiences motivate me to live authentically according to my feminist roots and to strive for equality for everyone.</p>

                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li>Re-read the section entitled “Other Persistent Problems Affecting Women in Canada” in this chapter and choose one of the identified issues to explore in greater depth. Write a brief paper that explains how women tend to be at a disadvantage in terms of programs and legislation related to minimum wage, pensions, or Employment Insurance. Suggest some changes that would increase equality in the area you’ve chosen to examine, and provide research to support your ideas.</li>
                        <li>The suicide of 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons in 2013 created renewed awareness of the issues of sexual assault, cyberbullying, and victim blaming. Explore the use of social media to perpetrate abuse against women and present an argument for some form of legislation to combat this phenomenon.</li>
                        <li>Gender-based analysis Plus (GBA+) is a tool that helps to assess the differential impact of proposed and/or existing policies, programs, and legislation on both women and men. Go to the Status of Women Canada website (www.swc-cfc.gc.ca) and search for “Gender-based analysis Plus.” Write a two-page paper on how GBA+ can help inform social work practice. While the model was developed to inform policy analysis, you might find that it is just as relevant to direct practice. How could the eight steps of GBA+ be applied in direct practice?</li>
