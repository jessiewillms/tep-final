It is a positive sense of emotional and spiritual well-being that respects the importance of culture, equity, social justice, interconnections, and personal dignity” (PHAC, 2014).</p>

                <p>Organizations such as the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) exist to promote the mental health of Canadians, and they employ an increasing number of social workers who provide services at the community level. These workers operate on the principles of empowerment, peer and family support, participation in decision making, citizenship, and inclusion in community life. They dedicate themselves to helping people who are experiencing mental illness and their families to develop resilience as they embark on a journey of recovery together. Their mission is accomplished through advocacy, education, research, and service.</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">Positive mental health is closely related to the development of psychological and emotional resilience—the ability to recover or “bounce back” from crises or change. Resilience depends on many things: individual characteristics and lifestyle, family circumstances, ties to community, and environmental factors. Some of these factors can increase our resilience by protecting us from psychological harm, but some can expose us to psychological risk. We can learn to manage certain factors to strengthen our resilience.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-208" class="ch-link"></a>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">mental health</span> as &ldquo;a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The WHO considers mental wellness an integral part of the general definition of health. In the WHO Constitution, for example, health is defined as &ldquo;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>As with physical health, the best way to understand emotional health, or mental wellness, is to view it as a continuum. All of us lie somewhere on this mental health continuum, depending on our unique genetic makeup, environmental factors, and family dynamics. Our position on the continuum may shift from time to time, depending on events and stressors in our lives.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Mental wellness.</span> At one end of the continuum is &ldquo;mental wellness&rdquo; (also referred to as &ldquo;mental well-being&rdquo;). Mental wellness exists when there is a reasonable balance in all aspects of one&rsquo;s life&shy;&mdash;physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and spiritual.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Mental illness.</span> At the other end of the continuum is &ldquo;mental illness,&rdquo; a term referring to a range of emotional and mental health problems that may be long-lasting and that may interfere with normal family, school, social, or work-related activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The factors that contribute to mental well-being are not entirely understood. Clearly, some factors are related to an individual&rsquo;s life circumstances at any given time. In the case of severe mental illness, the causes are usually deeper, and medical professionals generally intervene to provide diagnosis and treatment.</p>
                        <p>In the same way that physical illnesses can take many different forms, so too can mental illnesses. Unfortunately, in the wider community, mental illnesses are still feared and misunderstood by many people. Myths and misconceptions concerning mental illness abound in popular culture and in mass media. In contrast to exaggerated stereotypes, mental illness can be treated, and most individuals with a mental illness can lead a normal and fulfilled life.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Safeguarding Mental Wellness: Risk Factors and Protective Factors</p>
                        <p>Various factors influence an individual&rsquo;s emotions and state of mind at any stage of life. Some such factors, called &ldquo;risk factors,&rdquo; include physical illness, family problems, physical or sexual abuse, childhood trauma, difficult relationships, and heredity. When present, these factors can predispose a person to greater levels of stress and more complex unsettling emotions.</p>
                        <p>There are also &ldquo;protective factors&rdquo; that work in the opposite way, to stabilize our emotional well-being. As the name suggests, these protective factors&mdash;strong family ties and close interpersonal relationships, for example&mdash;can reduce or minimize the likelihood of undue emotional hardship.</p>
                        <p>When a person experiences a number of unfortunate events all at once, the combined effect can take its toll on that individual&rsquo;s mental health. In extreme cases, the sheer weight of circumstances can overwhelm an individual, to the point where he or she will need to seek professional help in order to deal with the problems at hand.</p>
                        <p>Just as with physical illness, the prognosis of mental illness is better if the illness is detected as early as possible and if early remedial action is taken. Social workers play a critical role in helping to prevent mental illness while at the same time promoting mental well-being.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-211" class="ch-link"></a> is a condition that involves disturbances in a person&rsquo;s thoughts, emotions, moods, and behaviours, which decrease that person&rsquo;s capacity to cope with the challenges of everyday life. The term &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; is generally used to refer to serious mental health problems that are diagnosed and treated by mental health professionals. The terms &ldquo;mental health problem,&rdquo; &ldquo;mental illness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo; are often used interchangeably. Diagnosis criteria and treatment protocols for mental illnesses are contained in the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-5,</em> published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>
                        <p>All of us are vulnerable to mental health problems. As mentioned earlier, the state of our mental health, at any given time, can lie anywhere along a continuum between well and not well. The first signs of a serious mental illness often appear between the ages of 15 and 30. The signs and symptoms of mental illness differ according to the illness and the individual.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Factors Contributing to Mental Illness</p>
                        <p>We do not know exactly what causes mental illness, but it is believed that a combination of factors contribute to its onset and severity. These factors include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--li">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Genetic factors.</span> It is believed that some mental health problems occur more often in families in which there is a history of mental illness.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Biological factors.</span> Age and gender, for example, are believed to affect the rate and prevalence of mental illness, especially when combined with other factors.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Environmental factors.</span> Stresses due to finances, relationships, family background, and lack of access to health care and social supports are all believed to affect mental health.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Physical factors.</span> Symptoms of mental illness can occur in people with a physical illness&mdash;for example, people who experience a physical illness may also experience severe depression.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In one important respect, mental illness is no different from physical illness&mdash;professional help is often required to relieve the symptoms and alleviate or reverse the problem. For many years, it was thought that mental health problems would keep coming back or would never go away. It is now known that many people recover from such challenges. With careful treatment and appropiate support, the symptoms of these disorders can be managed in much the same way that diabetes can be managed, for example&mdash;with lifestyle changes and medication. In many cases, the individual can experience complete recovery.</p>
                        <p>People with continuing emotional and mental health problems will often have difficulties in other parts of their lives, such as employment, housing, or relationships. While medical professionals can do a great deal to diagnose and treat mental health conditions, the consequences of mental illness can be far reaching, for the individual as well as for his or her family and friends.</p>
                        <p>Social workers today recognize that &ldquo;whatever makes it difficult for the individual, the group, and the environment to interact effectively and justly (for example, poverty, prejudice, discrimination, disadvantage, marginality, or poor coordination of or access to resources) is a threat or barrier to mental health.... Our interactions with others take place within a framework of societal values; therefore, any definition of mental health or mental illness must reflect the kind of people and the type of society we aspire to be and the goals we consider desirable. Social workers do not isolate ideas about mental health from such wider social values as the desire for equality among people, the free pursuit of legitimate individual and collective goals, and equitable distribution and exercise of power&rdquo; (CASW website, 2016).</p>

Initially, the commission received a ten-year mandate (2007&ndash;2017), but on April 21, 2015, then-Minister of Finance Joe Oliver announced that the 2015 federal budget called for the renewal of the MHCC for another ten years, starting in 2017&ndash;2018.</p>
                        <p>The organization is governed by a board that includes both governmental and non-governmental directors. Since 2013, the board has been assisted by an advisory council and a network of ambassadors. From 2007 to 2012, the board was assisted by eight advisory committees. The commission is not responsible for undertaking service delivery or advocacy for mental health services. Its aim, rather, is to provide relevant jurisdictions and stakeholders with the tools and information required to improve the quality of mental health care and access to it for all citizens in Canada.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The MHCC was tasked originally with three major objectives:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">To develop a national mental health strategy</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">To oversee the development and implementation of an anti-stigma and</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">anti-discrimination campaign</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To create a Knowledge Exchange Centre, with the aim of mobilizing evidence-based knowledge to improve best practices and increase dialogue about mental health issues across&nbsp;Canada</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The MHCC&rsquo;s Main Initiatives and Accomplishments to Date</p>
                        <p>On May 8, 2012, Canada became the last of the G8 nations to create a national mental health strategy. A document entitled Changing Directions, Changing Lives: The Mental Health Strategy for Canada set out six strategic aims related to the implementation, prevention, diversity, access, and delivery of services.</p>
                        <p>The commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; research project (&ldquo;Chez Soi&rdquo; in French) looked to address homelessness for people with mental illness by combining treatment with places to live, and is the largest experiment of its kind in the world. Operating in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montr&eacute;al, and Moncton, the project is based on the Housing First model of the Pathways to Housing program in the United States, which has reported positive results in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, and Washington.</p>
                        <p>Another important MHCC initiative is called &ldquo;Opening Minds,&rdquo; launched in 2009 to combat stigma against mental illness. This program has been involved with 65 partners and 45 active projects. The directors of the commission decided that the projects would focus on four target groups, namely, health-care providers, youth aged 12 to 18, the media, and the workforce.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">MHCC Initiatives of Relevance to Social Work</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-216" class="ch-link"></a>Mental health problems are widespread and have a major impact on the workplace and the economy. There are many sources of stress, yet there seem to be some common causes. In a survey of over 1,500 working adults, 30 percent of Canadians point to finances as their top stressor; 17 percent say family matters and 6 percent say lack of time is their biggest stressor. In the same survey, 19 percent of Canadians say work pressure causes them the most stress (The Psychology Foundation of Canada and Desjardins Financial Security, 2007).</p>
                        <p>Partly in response to the prevalance of workplace-related mental health concerns, a Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course was launched by the MHCC in 2010. The course has been thoroughly evaluated and has been found effective in improving participants&rsquo; knowledge of mental disorders and increasing the amount of help provided to others. On January 16, 2013, the MHCC released the <em>Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace Standard,</em> a framework aimed at combatting mental illness and identifying mental health hazards in the workplace.</p>
                        <p>MHCC has also initiated <em>Informing the Future: Mental Health Indicators for Canada</em> to paint a picture of mental health in our country. These indicators provide information on the mental health status of children and youth, adults, and older Canadians, as well as information on how the mental health care system responds to mental illness.</p>

                        <p><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">Stigmatization</span>
                            <a href="#" id="page-217" class="ch-link"></a> is the expression of negative attitudes and behaviours toward individuals who share a certain characteristic. In the wider community, persons with a mental illness are often stigmatized and outcast, even though they need the same understanding and support as persons with a physical illness. People who stigmatize others cast uninformed judgements on them and form fixed ideas about their illness. Stigma worsens the suffering that results from having a mental health problem.</p>
                        <p>Stereotyping, another harmful reaction to the occurrence of mental illness, often goes hand in hand with stigmatization. It is often expressed through demeaning labels, such as &ldquo;psycho,&rdquo; &rdquo;insane,&rdquo; &ldquo;addict,&rdquo; or &ldquo;junkie.&rdquo; Negative words as well as negative actions can inflict further emotional damage upon a person who is mentally unwell.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Importance of Destigmatization in Mental Health</p>
                        <p>Presuming that people with a mental illness can never hold a job or that the problem is &ldquo;all in their head&rdquo; are forms of stigma. So are attitudes based on the misconception that all people who have a mental illness are a danger to society. These prejudices, negative attitudes, and discrimination can affect the ways in which people with mental health issues are treated by others. The effects of stigmatization can be both detrimental and debilitating.</p>
                        <p>To make matters worse, those who are suffering from mental health issues often internalize the stigma and the negative stereotypes imposed on them by others, which can damage their self-image and self-esteem.</p>
                        <p>Stigma can also diminish an individual&rsquo;s quality of life by</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">reducing the person&rsquo;s ability to maintain relationships or acquire new relationships, which can lead to social isolation;</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">inducing reluctance and/or avoidance in seeking help for mental health issues;</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">causing a person to keep symptoms a secret from others;</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">reinforcing belief in the negative attitudes that are expressed by others and/or by the media, which can lead to self-stigmatization; and</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">setting up obstacles to acceptance and support from family members, friends, and&nbsp;community.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Stigma affects everyone involved in the mental health system. To support individuals who are struggling with a mental illness, it is important for social workers to recognize the various forms that stigma can take, the many negative ways in which it can affect individuals, and some effective strategies to decrease stigmatization.</p>
                        <p>Developing awareness of how stigma and stereotypes affect others and questioning our own attitudes and feelings are ways to decrease stigma on an individual basis. This is especially important for social workers to understand and practise. They may find themselves interacting with health-care professionals who lack competence and training in assessing and treating individuals who express suicidal ideation, for example, which may contribute to stigma and poor outcomes. It is also essential for social workers to recognize that many consumers of mental health services may have had a negative experience involving stigmatization at some point in their lives.</p>

Across Canada, many individuals, organizations, and initiatives are striving to decrease stigma in relation to mental health.</p>
                                            <p>For example, Stop the Stigma is a partnership between the Mood Disorders Association of Ontario and the Toronto District School Board that trains students to serve as leaders during mental health awareness weeks in their schools. Students give presentations on topics such as youth mental health and how to access support services.</p>
                                            <p>As another example, the Schizophrenia Society of Ontario has implemented an initiative called Sound Off (Turtert, 2014). This campaign was founded by University of Toronto student Mona Abadi in 2011, in an attempt to reach out to youth across Ontario to create open discussions surrounding mental health. The goal was to give youth an opportunity to share their stories and have their voices heard in a public forum.</p>
                                            <p>The Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) strongly advocates for the abolition of stigma within the context of mental health. In June 2012, the MHCC and the World Psychiatric Association hosted the fifth international conference on stigma reduction, titled “Together against Stigma: Changing How We See Mental Illness.”</p>
                                            <p>The largest stigma-related event ever, the conference invited 670 researchers, practitioners, policy makers, advocates, caregivers, and people with lived experience to Ottawa to share research, programs, best practices, and personal stories. The conference’s main purpose was to encourage citizens everywhere to talk about how to bring about positive change in the way people view mental illness.</p>

                                            <p>Stigma is the number one reason why two thirds of those living with a mental illness do not seek help. Bell Canada’s“Let’s Talk” is a multi-year charitable program dedicated to mental health. Bell has committed over $100 million to support a wide range of mental health organizations, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. (Bell Let’s Talk, 2015).</p>

                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-220" class="ch-link"></a>The recovery model is a concept that has been integrated into mental health services and treatments relatively recently. In the past, individuals experiencing mental health issues and their families were often told to lower their expectations in light of the fact that the individual’s symptoms would probably worsen over time (Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario, 2015). Today, however, the idea of recovery is an important foundation for how social workers and other health professionals engage with individuals living with mental health issues and with their families.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Essential Components of the Recovery Model</p>
                                            <p>Recovery encompasses a holistic approach toward treatment. A holistic approach “embraces the interconnectedness of our body, mind, and spirit, and encourages us to cultivate physical, mental, and spiritual health” (Hong Fook Mental Health Association, 2008). This approach focuses on the person as a whole rather than on symptoms alone, and it avoids making assumptions based on an individual’s diagnosis (Mental Health First Aid, 2010).</p>
                                            <p>Hope is one of the main components of the recovery model. It is vitally important for workers in the field of mental health to relay a message of hope. Regardless of the symptoms that a person might experience, individuals living with a mental illness can avail themselves of every opportunity to lead fulfilling and satisfying lives. Championing hope involves adopting an open-minded perspective, cultivating a sense of life’s possibilities, and learning to use the language of recovery—notions that stray markedly from past attitudes toward mental illness. Hope bolsters the idea that recovery is possible for anyone struggling with a mental illness.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">“Recovery” in the Context of Mental Illness</p>
                                            <p>The term “recovery” in relation to mental illness has a different connotation than when it is applied to physical illness or injury (Trainor et al., 2004). Moreover, in a mental health context, recovery does not necessarily mean absence of symptoms. The recovery model affirms the potential to lead a meaningful life despite co-existing symptoms.</p>
                                            <p>There is no single definition for recovery, which is often referred to as a journey or a process (Mental Health Foundation, 2015). This journey involves devising ways to lead a satisfying, hopeful, and productive life despite limitations that may be associated with a mental illness. Furthermore, recovery involves redefining one’s purpose in life and constructing
                                                <br />new meanings that transcend the effects of living with a mental illness.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">What Factors Influence Recovery?</p>
                                            <p>Recovery is a highly personal and unique process (Trainor et al., 2004). In a mental health context, recovery is seen as person-driven; each individual defines what recovery means to him or her.</p>
                                            <p>For some people, recovery might mean being symptom-free, while for others it could mean staying in control of their thoughts and behaviours despite their mental illness (Mental Health Foundation, 2015).</p>
                                            <p>The recovery model implies that individuals, families, and service providers must often shift their view about mental health and mental illness. They learn to adjust to the notion that individuals play a key role in their own recovery.</p>
                                            <p>Furthermore, recovery involves building upon strengths. It is essential to mobilize and tap into individuals’ talents, resources, and potential instead of focusing on their illness, symptoms, and problems.</p>
                                            <p>Recovery also means that individuals take responsibility for and control their own health-related choices. There is a shift in focus from illness to wellness, a lessened emphasis on symptoms, and diminished preoccupation with diagnosis, medication, and treatment in favour of focusing on more rewarding life experiences.</p>
                                            <p>Factors that can influence recovery include access to education and employment opportunities, quality and availability of treatment, and supportive social networks (Mental Health First Aid, 2011). Individuals’ ability and willingness to participate in their own treatment also influences recovery.</p>
                                            <p>Recovery is aptly described as a deeply personal and unique process of transforming one’s attitudes, feelings, values, skills, goals, and roles (Trainor et al., 2004). Because recovery is an individualized process, social workers must adapt to the remarkable diversity of persons living with mental illness.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-221" class="ch-link"></a>The ultimate goal of countless mental health services and treatments is recovery. Therefore, workers who engage with individuals experiencing mental health issues are entrusted with supporting their recovery process. This process starts with the acknowledgement that recovery is possible in spite of the complex issues that arise from living with a mental illness.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Family Involvement: A Crucial Factor in Recovery</p>
                                            <p>Families are the single largest category of caregivers of people who are suffering from a mental illness (Trainor et al., 2004). Family members thus play a pivotal role in an individual’s recovery.</p>
                                            <p>When a loved one is first diagnosed, his or her needs become paramount. Family members assume various roles, often providing significant financial, emotional, and social support. Their contributions may go unrecognized, however (Ibid., 2004).</p>
                                            <p>Living with and/or supporting a loved one with a mental illness can impact the personal health and well-being of members of that individual’s family. Family members often experience burnout, stress, and social isolation.</p>
                                            <p>Self-care becomes extremely important in maintaining a family’s overall health and wellness. Family members can learn a variety of coping skills to help them stave off burnout and exhaustion. Social workers can encourage family members to reach out and seek help for themselves through individual counselling or involvement in a support group.</p>

                                                <p>The program involves an educational and planning process that is grounded in mental health recovery concepts such as hope, education, empowerment, self-advocacy, and interpersonal support and connection.

                            <p class="text--caption">It is a common misconception that people who engage in drug use will develop a substance use disorder. The fact is that individuals can struggle with drug use and never become dependent (CAMH, 2016). For example, many people drink alcohol without problem.Alcohol and tobacco are licit (legal) drugs (Kendall et al., 2008). Licit drugs have addictive qualities similar to illicit (illegal) drugs, and substance use disorders can result from use of either type of drug. Abuse of prescription drugs (licit drugs) is common, leading to increased tolerance and withdrawal effects when stopped (Tyyskä, 2009). Licit drug use can also lead to addiction.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-222" class="ch-link"></a>Inappropriate or excessive use of alcohol or drugs can result in various mental, physical, or social impairments (Kendall et al., 2008). There are several types of alcohol and drug use and different levels of risk associated with each type. Risks vary depending on the intensity of the drug and on the frequency, circumstances, and modality of use. People can move back and forth between various types of use. Individuals have an increased risk of developing a <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">substance use disorder</span> if they use alcohol or drugs compulsively, are unable to control their use, and/or continue despite negative consequences.</p>
                        <p>A substance use disorder is defined as a physiological and/or psychological dependency on a drug to sustain a sense of well-being and to avoid withdrawal symptoms (Kendall et al., 2008). Two essential characteristics of substance use disorders are tolerance and withdrawal. Tolerance occurs when larger doses of a drug are required over time to replicate the same physical or psychological effect that could originally be achieved with a smaller dose. Withdrawal is characterized by the various physical and psychological symptoms that are associated with the discontinuation of a drug.</p>

                        <p>The overarching categories of substance use disorders are diagnosed based on the criteria described below.</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li><span class="text--bold">Alcohol use disorders.</span> Issues controlling alcohol intake, continued alcohol intake despite problems resulting from drinking, increased tolerance, or development of withdrawal symptoms.</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold">Cannabis use disorders</span>. Disruptions in functioning and development of withdrawal symptoms (difficulty sleeping, nervousness, anger, restlessness, and/or feelings of depression after a week of abstinence).</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold">Stimulant use disorders.</span> Craving for stimulants, issues controlling use, use of larger amounts over time, development of tolerance, and development of withdrawal symptoms (tiredness, difficulty sleeping, increased appetite, and vivid and unpleasant dreams). Amphetamines, methamphetamine, and cocaine are stimulants.</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold">Hallucinogen use disorders.</span> Cravings for hallucinogens, engaging in risky activities when using (e.g., driving), and continued use in spite of interference with obligations or social functioning. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms are hallucinogens.</li>
                            <li><span class="text--bold">Opioid use disorders.</span> Inability to control use, strong desire to obtain opioid, and withdrawal symptoms (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, fever, negative mood, and insomnia). Heroin, oxycodone, and hydrocodone are opioid drugs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Substance use disorders can have symptoms that reflect behavioural, physical, and social changes (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Behavioural changes may include decreased attention at work or school; substance use while driving; changes in appetite or sleep patterns; changes in personality or attitude without explanation; sudden mood swings; irritability; and engaging in suspicious behaviours. Physical changes may include abnormally sized pupils; red eyes; sudden change in weight (loss or gain); deterioration of physical appearance; unusual odours on breath, body, or clothing; and impaired coordination/speech. Social changes may include sudden isolation; unexplained financial need; use of substance despite problems with relationships; and sudden changes in hobbies or interests.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-223" class="ch-link"></a>Substance use disorders have been attributed to a variety of biological, psychological, and sociological factors (Kendall et al., 2008). Biological factors may include a genetic predisposition to substance use and substance use disorders. Moreover, drugs such as alcohol, heroin, and cocaine directly affect the brain mechanisms that are responsible for reward and punishment. Psychological factors focus on personality traits and the effects of social learning on behaviours associated with substance use. As well, personality disorders and other mental illnesses may increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing a substance use disorder. Sociological factors include the social determinants of health, such as poverty, unsafe communities, and low educational attainment. Patterns of substance use and substance use disorders vary by gender, race, social class, and ethnicity. Some populations appear to be more susceptible to drug use and substance use disorders than others. For example, as noted above, a population that may be more susceptible to substance use disorders are those who experience mental health issues.</p>

                        <p>Substance use has historically been&mdash;and will likely continue to be&mdash;one of the problems that social workers encounter most frequently, regardless of their role. In fact, in two studies conducted by the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), between 71 and 87 percent of social workers reported interacting with a client who had substance use issues (O&rsquo;Neil, 2001; Whitaker, Weismiller, and Clark, 2006).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Adopting a Harm-Reduction Approach</p>
                        <p>Social workers are at the forefront of developing innovative ways and evidence-based practices to help people with substance use disorders. Social workers and others in Canadian substance use programs adopt a harm-reduction approach. Harm reduction forms one of the pillars of provincial and national drug strategies (the other three pillars being prevention, treatment, and enforcement). Harm reduction refers to &ldquo;any strategy or behaviour that an individual uses to reduce the potential harm that may exist for him or her&rdquo; (Csiernik, 2011: 183). Harm reduction may involve abstinence&mdash;although abstinence is not necessarily a goal. Rather, harm reduction includes a range of options, such as adopting safer drug use techniques, using licit rather than illicit drugs, and decreasing the amount and/or frequency of use.</p>
                        <p>Although harm-reduction strategies have been available for decades, the emergence of AIDS and HIV raised their profile, particularly in relation to decreasing injection drug use. Harm-reduction principles are congruent with social work values, which promote a non-judgemental approach to substance users, recognize the principles of self-determination, perceive that outcomes are in the hands of the client, and provide options in a non-coercive way.</p>

                                                <a href="#" id="page-225" class="ch-link"></a>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s Toronto Drug Treatment Court (TDTC) program provides alternative intervention for some lawbreakers.</p>
                                            <p>In most cases, clients in custody apply through their lawyers to the TDTC—a joint collaboration between CAMH and the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General. The program is not available to violent offenders, so most applicants have been charged with crimes such as trafficking or simple possession, prostitution, or petty property crimes.</p>
                                            <p>Specifically, the TDTC looks for people whose criminal behaviour is directly linked to their need to support their addiction to cocaine, crack, or opiates. TDTC focuses on harm reduction by providing treatment for the underlying cause of illness, something that would be ignored within the prison system.</p>
                                            <p>The first step is a 30-day assessment. Throughout the client’s stay with the program, he or she attends a TDTC session twice a week, while simultaneously receiving treatment three days a week at CAMH. This program, like many others, recognizes that relapse is a part of recovery, especially in the early stages, and it supports clients during that period of time.</p>
                                            <p>Once the client is stable and a reduction in substance use is evident, the intensive stage of changing entrenched patterns of behaviour and thinking and living a healthier life begins. Clients are directed either to the Structured Relapse Prevention Program or to the Women’s or Youth Program. Those who are really struggling are referred to a residential treatment facility.</p>
                                            <p>In phase two, clients meet with CAMH caseworkers once a week; at this point clients are expected to be abstinent from their drug of choice (crack, cocaine, or opiates) and to be working on reducing use of secondary substances, such as marijuana or alcohol. Clients often discuss the root causes of their pain, such as childhood abuse, institutionalization, or child welfare experiences. They also attend a drug treatment course once a month.</p>
                                            <p>Caseworkers prepare clients for re-entry into school, work, and long-term housing. Closer to graduation, clients attend a support group one evening a week. To graduate from the program, clients must be drug-free for three months, in school, working, or volunteering, and in stable&#160;housing.</p>
                                            <p>The goal is to reduce the rate of recidivism among this population and to avoid the “revolving door” of crime and addiction that tends to exist when incarceration is used to deal with substance use disorders. CAMH’s recovery model allows for more success because it keeps clients in the TDTC.</p>
                                            <p>As one TDTC worker put it, “We’re helping our clients to recover in their communities by facing real issues and pressures and walking with them as they struggle.”</p>

                            <p class="text--caption">The term “dual diagnosis” is used interchangeably with “concurrent disorder” in some countries. In Canada, “dual diagnosis” is used when an individual experiences both a developmental disability and a mental health issue (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2015). The term “developmental disability” applies when an individual experiences significant limitations in cognitive functioning and adaptive functioning. Examples of developmental disability include autism, traumatic brain injury, and Down syndrome.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-226" class="ch-link"></a>Understanding and knowledge of concurrent disorders has increased over the last two decades in response to the growing number of individuals who experience both a substance use disorder and a mental illness. A <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-6">concurrent disorder</span> is defined as a condition in which a person suffers simultaneously from a mental health issue and a substance use disorder (Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario, 2015).</p>
                        <p>Combinations of concurrent disorders can be divided into five main groups (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2015):</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use accompanied by a mood or anxiety disorder (e.g., depression, panic disorder)</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use accompanied by a severe and persistent mental health issue (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use accompanied by a personality disorder (e.g., borderline personality disorder)</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use accompanied by an eating disorder (ie.g., anorexia nervosa, bulimia)</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Substance use accompanied by a mental health disorder (e.g., gambling)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Specific examples of combinations are depression and alcohol use (disorder); schizophrenia and cannabis use (disorder); and anxiety disorder and sedative- or anxiolytic-related use (disorder), that is, opiod use (disorder).</p>
                        <p>According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH, 2015), the following mental health issues are common among those who experience concurrent disorders:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Anxiety disorders.</span> Approximately 10 to 25 percent of people develop an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Among the individuals diagnosed, 24 percent will also experience a substance use disorder in their lifetime.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Major depression.</span> Approximately 15 to 20 percent of people develop major depression in their lifetime. Among the individuals diagnosed, 27 percent will also experience a substance use disorder in their lifetime.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Bipolar disorder.</span> Approximately 1 to 2 percent of people develop bipolar disorder in their lifetime. Among the individuals diagnosed, 56 percent will also experience a substance use disorder in their lifetime.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold">Schizophrenia.</span> Approximately 1 percent of people develop schizophrenia in their lifetime. Among the individuals diagnosed, 47 percent will also experience a substance use disorder in their lifetime.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Interplay Between Mental Health Disorders and Substance Use Disorders</p>
                        <p>Individuals who experience mental health issues have an increased risk of developing substance use disorders, as they find ways to &ldquo;self-medicate&rdquo; for any distress they may experience due to their mental health issues. Conversely, specific illicit drugs can cause individuals to experience symptoms of a mental health issue (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2015).</p>
                        <p>Statistics show that 30 percent of individuals diagnosed with a mental health issue will also experience a substance use disorder at some point in their lives (CAMH, 2015). Comparatively, 37 percent of individuals who experience an alcohol use disorder will develop a mental health issue. And 53 percent of individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder (other than alcohol) will experience a mental health issue at some stage of their lives.</p>

                        <p>The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH, 2015) has found that individuals who experience mental health issues are a vulnerable population, and experiencing substance use disorders simultaneously can make it more difficult to get help. An individual who experiences a concurrent disorder will often experience more serious medical, social, or emotional issues). Individuals who experience concurrent disorders must receive treatment for both issues. Therefore, treatment may take longer and prove more challenging. It is important for social workers to establish treatment for both issues to promote their clients&rsquo; chances of recovery.</p>
                        <p>The treatment approach depends on the type and severity of an individual&rsquo;s issues. The individual may receive psychosocial treatments (individual or group therapy) or biological treatments (medications), or both. Although it is essential to consider both issues, depending on the severity of the substance use and the severity of the mental illness, it may be necessary to treat one issue first, rather than treating both concurrently.</p>

In Canada, 13.4 percent of people over the age of 15 have seriously considered suicide at one point in their lives (Mental Health First Aid Canada, 2011). Moreover, 3,500 to 4,000 Canadians of various ages die by suicide each year. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death of Canadians aged 15 to 24. Furthermore, Canada has the third-highest youth suicide rate in the industrialized world. Clearly, suicide is becoming an increasingly predominant mental health problem in Canadian society.</p>
                                            <p>Individuals often turn to suicide when they experience deep feelings of hopelessness and helplessness over a prolonged period of time. In other cases, suicide can be an impulsive act. Suicide has a ripple effect; most often, after an individual commits suicide, their families, friends, and other social circles are heavily impacted and frequently devastated. The effect of stigma surrounding suicide can be especially damaging; it is a major barrier preventing people from engaging in conversations about suicide (Ibid, 201I).</p>

                                            <p>Suicide does not necessary follow an escalating continuum. However, there are warning signs that an individual may be contemplating suicide. These warning signs include the following behaviours (Mental Health First Aid Canada, 2011):</p>

                                            <p>This list is not exhaustive. Each individual can exhibit different signs of impending suicide. It is vitally important for family members, support workers, and mental health professionals to familiarize themselves with the warning signs and risk factors related to suicide.</p>

                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Protective Factors</p>
                                            <p>Certain protective factors may reduce the risk of suicide. As mentioned previously, protective factors aid an individual’s capacity to recover stability in the course of a stressful situation. Assessing an individual’s protective factors can be an integral part of suicide risk reduction.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="#" id="page-229" class="ch-link"></a>According to organizations such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, protective factors can be internal or external. Internal factors may include a person’s resilience and ability to cope with stress, their religious beliefs, or their levels of tolerance for emotional distress. External factors may include a feeling of responsibility toward others (e.g., children, partner, parents, siblings, friends, co-workers, pets); positive therapeutic relationships with mental health professionals, including social workers; and various social supports, such as an affiliation with a place of worship or a self-help group.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Safety Plans</p>
                                            <p>Safety plans can be a key factor in suicide risk reduction. Such plans are completed by the individual, and they can be extremely helpful when that person is experiencing a crisis. Such plans are devised when the person is in comparatively good spirits and is able to reflect on how they behave when they are experiencing suicidal ideations.</p>
                                            <p>An effective safety plan will result if the person is able to identify strategies that would reduce their risk of committing suicide during a crisis. A safety plan might include names and phone numbers of people and services to contact when a person is in distress. The people and services listed in the safety plan might include family members, close friends, crisis support agencies, emergency helplines, and contact information for support personnel, such as a psychiatrist and/or a social worker.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Organizations Seeking to Prevent Suicide</p>
                                            <p>The Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) is a Canada-wide, non-profit organization that is dedicated to suicide prevention. This organization aims to reduce the rates of suicide in Canada and to decrease the negative connotations associated with suicide and/or suicidal behaviour. CASP also provides certification courses for crisis workers and facilitates a yearly conference that brings together researchers and other health professionals to discuss the most effective methods of suicide prevention. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.suicideprevention.ca" class="a--link-url">www.suicideprevention.ca</a></span>.)</p>
                                            <p>The International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) is dedicated to the prevention of suicidal behaviour, the alleviation of the effects of suicide, and the promotion of a forum for academics, mental health professionals, crisis workers, volunteers, and suicide survivors. The IASP includes professionals and volunteers from more than 50 countries, and officially partners with the World Health Organization (WHO). (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.iasp.info" class="a--link-url">www.iasp.info</a></span>.)</p>
                                            <p>The Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) is a branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association in Calgary, Alberta. The CSP is an educational centre that hosts the largest English-language library dedicated to the collection and distribution of suicide prevention, intervention, and post-intervention resources. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.suicideinfo.ca" class="a--link-url">www.suicideinfo.ca</a></span>.)</p>
                                            <p>The Jack Project was founded in 2010 by Eric Windeler and his wife, Sandra Hanington, after their son Jack died by suicide in his first year at Queen’s University. Now known as jack.org, the project encourages youth to engage, raise awareness, and reduce the stigma around the topic of mental health issues. It is the only national network of young leaders focused on peer-to-peer engagement in mental health issues. (For more information, visit their website: <span class="a--link-text"><a href="http://www.jack.org" class="a--link-url">www.jack.org</a></span>.)</p>
                                            <p>For a generation of young people raised on the Internet, social media, and text messaging, the traditional approach to mental health awareness and stigma reduction just isn’t working. One of the most powerful ways to inspire students is for young people to share their experiences and spread the message that we all have mental health issues and that it is all right to reach out for help.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-230" class="ch-link"></a>A traumatic event is often defined as an event in which a person experiences, witnesses, or is confronted with a situation that involves actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to one&rsquo;s physical integrity or that of others. In response to these stressors, an individual&rsquo;s reactions may include fear, helplessness, shock, and/or denial (Wilson and Keane, 2004).</p>
                        <p>Examples of traumatic events include the following:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">Domestic violence and/or child abuse/neglect</li>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item">A natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, flood, earthquake)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When an individual is beset by constant thoughts and/or memories of a traumatic experience, and if these thoughts and memories persist or worsen over time, the person may develop <span class="span--keyword text--red">post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</span> Individuals who are especially susceptible to experiencing PTSD are emergency personnel (firefighters, police officers, and paramedics); correctional officers; military personnel; victims of war; refugees; and immigrants. The criteria used to diagnosis this disorder are constantly reviewed due to its impact on people worldwide and the many ways in which traumatic events can damage individuals.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Signs and Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</p>
                        <p>PTSD usually appears within three months of the traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear for years after the occurrence. Common general symptoms include reliving the event, avoiding reminders of the event, losing emotional control, and always feeling that something bad is going to happen. Specific symptoms may include recurring nightmares about the event; unwanted, disturbing memories of the event; avoidance of activities, places, or people that are reminders of the event; isolation from family and friends; loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities; difficulty displaying affection; inability to feel pleasure; constant worrying; difficulty concentrating; shortened temper; changes in sleep patterns (trouble falling asleep and staying asleep); experiencing sudden attacks of dizziness, increased heartbeat, or shortness of breath; and fears of death.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Risk Factors and Protective Factors Associated with PTSD</p>
                        <p>Women are more likely than men to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, and the disorder can occur at any age. Although a correlation has been established between traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder, not everyone who experiences a traumatic event develops PTSD (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 2010). Risk factors include inadequate social support following the traumatic event; feelings of guilt, shame, or responsibility for the event; or encountering other stressors after the event, e.g., the loss of a spouse, job, or home. Risk factors specific to the traumatic experience also include the severity, duration, and proximity of exposure to the event (Statistics Canada, 2013).</p>
                        <p>Protective factors that mitigate against developing PTSD include finding support from friends and family; participating in a support group following a traumatic event; applying coping strategies; and being able to learn from a traumatic experience.</p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#" id="page-231" class="ch-link"></a>Early detection of PTSD is a key component in recovery. Support for individuals who have been diagnosed with PTSD may include family service agencies; community mental health agencies; counsellors or therapists; family doctors; community health centres; settlement agencies; and workplace Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). Because relationships can become strained when an individual experiences PTSD, families may also seek support.</p>
                        <p>Counselling, one-on-one or group therapy, and medication for depression, anxiety, and sleep problems are common treatments for individuals diagnosed with PTSD (Wilson and Keane, 2004). A holistic approach encompassing several treatment options may lead to improved chances of recovery. One common therapeutic approach is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in which individuals learn to change their thought patterns to overcome their anxiety and other symptoms (Statistics Canada, 2013).</p>
                        <p>Another approach that is proving effective is cognitive processing therapy (CPT). In 2015, through a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and with help from Veterans Affairs Canada, Ryerson professor Candice Monson began to conduct research and training of front-line providers who deal with veterans who are experiencing PTSD. Monson is advancing CPT as a trauma-focused therapy that allows individuals to work through their past experiences by confronting the emotions related to traumatizing events.</p>
                        <p>Throughout Canada, 134 clinicians who traditionally treat veterans have been recruited to assist in Monson&rsquo;s study by delivering CPT to people affected by PTSD. As of 2015, more than 500 veterans had been treated using this therapeutic approach.</p>

Social work&rsquo;s historical perspective of viewing the person within his/her environment sets it apart from other professions.</p>

                                            <p>Social workers practise in diverse sectors of mental health, such as community mental health programs, adult psychiatric inpatient and outpatient services, children&rsquo;s mental health services, primary health care, and private practice. Additionally, social work services include, but are not limited to, assertive community treatment (ACT), early intervention, specialized geriatric psychiatry, corrections, treatment for substance use and <span class="span--keyword text--red">concurrent disorders,</span> and education and training.</p>
                                            <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Workers&rsquo; Contributions to Mental Health</p>
                                            <p>Social workers have contributed two key ideas to the mental health field. First, they have expanded the understanding of mental health. Social work has highlighted the influence of social and economic factors, family and other relationships, and the physical and organizational environment on individual mental health. The role of physiological processes, human biology, and experience are now viewed within the wider social context. Second, although social workers must understand and refer to the DSM-5, they avoid overusing labels such as &ldquo;depressed,&rdquo; &ldquo;schizophrenic,&rdquo; &ldquo;manic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hyperactive&rdquo; because stigmatizing labels are a barrier and discourage individuals and their families from getting the help they need.</p>
                                            <p>Many individuals involved in mental health systems have reported feeling that they are being stigmatized by staff (Perlman et al., 2011). Social workers must be mindful of their own biases, therefore, when interacting with clients. Social workers are in a unique position to help decrease stigmatization. When social workers maintain openness, acceptance, and willingness to examine and perhaps discuss their own liabilities, these attitudes may help minimize feelings of guilt, shame, and stigma that a person affected by a mental illness may experience (Ibid., 2011).</p>
                                            <p>The education, skills, and knowledge required by social workers in mental health include, but are not limited to,</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-234" class="ch-link"></a>Growing numbers of immigrants and refugees are settling in Canada. The stress of adapting to a new society in the face of language and cultural barriers places immigrants and refugees at risk for anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. These problems can worsen when immigrants and refugees must also overcome challenges such as illness, poverty, and geographic isolation. Older adults who have limited English proficiency and are experiencing difficulties resettling are especially at risk because they cannot easily understand or access social services.</p>
                        <p>Social work with immigrants and refugees involves developing an understanding of the unique aspects of immigrants’ and refugees’ lives. Older immigrants and refugees in particular may feel overwhelmed. They may have experienced the trauma of war or persecution, separation from family and homeland, and the loss of loved ones. They may lack any sense of control over their lives, and experience cycles of crisis followed by boredom and hopelessness.</p>
                        <p>The role of social workers serving immigrants and refugees is to work with clients to identify and help them overcome any barriers to the resettlement process. There are many strategies that social workers can apply to ensure that their interactions with such clients are beneficial. According to social workers who have extensive experience with immigrant and refugee populations, the most important factors to consider include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">The need for culturally competent practice. </span>Social workers must educate themselves about a client’s cultural background and determine how the person’s culture tends to view issues such as aging, mental health, gender roles, and power relations within families. Simultaneously, social workers must remember that each client is an individual with unique experiences that will shape his or her interactions with the social services system.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Family dynamics. </span>A social worker serving a client who is an immigrant or refugee must often interact with a large number of family members. Thus, understanding the dynamics among family members provides clues as to how to best help the client. The worker must get to know the family’s structure. For example, if a worker spends time with only female family members but the men in the family hold the power, the worker’s efforts may be misdirected.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">The value of social connections.</span> Because isolation is often a concern of immigrants and refugees, it is important for a social worker to assess clients’ social connectedness and link them with community organizations, places of worship, and other support networks.</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item"><span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">The need for patience and respect. </span>These qualities are necessary in any social work interaction, but they are especially important when working with older immigrants and refugees because these clients may be particularly reluctant to access services. A trusting relationship with such clients may take time to build, and a comment or action that a client perceives as disrespectful could cause irreparable damage. If a client is made to feel needy or “talked down to,” he or she may retreat. Facilitating a therapeutic alliance based on respect for both the individual and the individual’s cultural norms is essential to a positive outcome, as the next story demonstrates.</li>

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help relieve the symptoms of a mood disturbance.</p>
                            <p>Anwar is a 58-year-old man from Turkey who immigrated with his family to a city in Canada two years ago. He has been married for 28 years and has three daughters aged 23, 19, and 14. For the past month, Anwar has been spending much of the day in bed, which has led to quarrels with his wife. She pleads with him to visit a community mental health centre.</p>
                            <p>Reluctantly, and after much emotionally-charged persuading from his wife and daughters, Anwar books an appointment with Lorraine, a social worker at the mental health centre. During the initial appointment, he tells Lorraine that he has a ten-year history of depression and anxiety. He was diagnosed with a mood disorder by a family doctor back home. His symptoms include low energy, poor concentration, shortness of breath, sweaty palms, and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness regarding the future. These symptoms occur mainly when he is alone. He does not have thoughts of suicide and has never made an&#160;attempt.</p>
                            <p>Anwar lost his job three months ago and has been struggling with the resettlement process. He feels isolated both culturally and socially, and is beset by feelings of worthlessness. He holds traditional cultural views about gender roles; he sees men as strong providers and women as nurturers. Thus, it is a source of shame to him that he is out of work and is so unable to control his moods that he must seek professional help.</p>
                            <p>During their first session together, Lorraine asks Anwar if he would be comfortable answering some questions about his background and personal history as part of a psychosocial assessment to help her understand his situation better. She reassures him that he is under no obligation to answer these questions and that he may stop the interview at any time if he feels uncomfortable for any reason. Lorraine poses a series of questions to Anwar about his family history, upbringing, medical history, education, employment status, and current family dynamics. It becomes clear to Lorraine that Anwar holds a negative view of himself as worthless and inadequate and that he believes there is little hope for improvement in his life.</p>
                            <p>Lorraine explains to Anwar that our experiences can be viewed from four perspectives: our moods, thoughts, behaviours, and physical reactions. Small changes in any one of these areas can result in changes that help reverse the downward spiral of depression. She explains that in CBT sessions, the therapist asks a series of questions designed to help a client gradually discover different ways of thinking about themselves and their situation, and to consider how their behaviours and thoughts are related.</p>
                            <p>As an example, Lorraine asks Anwar to rate his mood today on a scale of one to ten. When he says, “Six,” she asks him how he remembers yesterday, and he responds, “Four.” She asks him what is different between yesterday and today. He laughs and replies, “I had to get out of bed and come to see you.” Lorraine connects how Anwar’s behaviour has affected his mood as an example of CBT. Anwar then comments, “I definitely feel more hopeful today that my life can get better,” and Lorraine is able to connect his thinking patterns to his overall mood.</p>
                            <p>Lorraine asks Anwar if he would be open to meeting with her on a weekly basis to work together to develop some cognitive behavioural therapy goals for him. Alternatively, Lorraine offers to refer Anwar to a colleague of hers at the clinic, a male social worker who is highly skilled in cognitive behavioural therapy. Lorraine senses that Anwar is embarrassed at appearing “weak” as a man and infers that he might feel less emotionally guarded with a male social worker. She suggests that he take time to reflect on this option and to let her know by the end of the week.</p>
                            <p>Because CBT for depression is often most effective when complemented by drug therapy, Lorraine also refers Anwar to a GP to assess the suitability of using an antidepressant to help relieve some of Anwar’s symptoms. At the end of the week, Anwar calls Lorraine to thank her and to say that he would like to engage in weekly CBT sessions with Lorraine’s male colleague. Lorraine thanks Anwar and then contacts her colleague to set up his first appointment with Anwar.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-236" class="ch-link"></a>The term “transitional youth” describes youth aged 15 to 24 who are transferring from children and/or youth mental health services to adult mental health services (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2015). Approaching adulthood is hard for any young person, but it is particularly difficult for young people who are experiencing mental health issues. Various factors account for the tendency of this vulnerable population to “slip through the cracks” of the mental health system.</p>
                        <p>Some youth disengage from services altogether due to a lack of transition management between different sectors of the mental health system (Ibid., 2015). In fact, this is one of the most pressing problems affecting transitional youth, who are often left to seek out services and supports on their own, with little help from the services and supports with whom they were previously engaged.</p>
                        <p>Traditional mental health services assist youth and adults through separate systems of care with no bridge between them. Given the lack of support in transitioning to adult services, many youth find their progress toward recovery becoming jeopardized.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Supporting Transitional Youth</p>
                        <p>A number of supports and strategies can be implemented when a social worker assists a youth who is transitioning from youth mental health services to adult mental health services. Interventions during this transition can positively impact the individual’s trajectory of mental health (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2015).</p>
                        <p>Effective planning on the part of the social worker is a key characteristic of effective transitions. Transitional planning should be initiated as soon as possible prior to discharge of services, and care plans developed as part of this plannning should be flexible enough to adjust to different service environments and the unique needs of the youth (Davidson et al., 2011). If the social worker invites the youth to participate in transitional planning prior to discharge as well, this partnership can help align the young person’s needs with the supports available in adult mental health services. Such an alignment serves to promote recovery.</p>
                        <p>Transition is most effective when improving transition is an important goal across sectors and between systems (Davidson et al., 2011). A social worker is most effective when connecting individuals with other agencies in a supportive manner. Making these connections involves more than providing contact information or a business card. An effective transition entails a case conference among those providing current supports and those providing desired supports to help ensure as seamless a shft as possible into the adult mental health sector.</p>
                        <p>In Mike’s story, a young man’s transtiion from youth mental health services to adult services is complicated by several problems, including the threat of homelessness. Acting as case manager, the social worker takes steps to liaise with the new case manager to ensure that Mike continues to engage with mental health services and to ensure as well that Mike’s needs, goals, and priorities are kept at the forefront of his care plan.</p>

                                <a href="#" id="page-237" class="ch-link"></a>Devising an effective discharge/care plan is key when a social worker facilitates an individual’s transition from youth mental health services to adult mental health services.</p>
                            <p>Mike is a 17-year-old male who lives with his parents in an urban community. He is the oldest of three children; his siblings are aged five and seven. At 15 years old, Mike was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder induced by marijuana use. One day he was smoking with his friends and experienced a hallucination. He went home and described it to his parents, who became frightened and brought him to the nearest hospital. Mike was in hospital for eight months, diagnosed, treated with antipsychotic medication, and then discharged.</p>
                            <p>Two weeks after he was discharged, Mike was admitted for services at a youth agency. Phil was assigned as Mike’s case manager. Mike’s parents expressed concerns about his illness and how it would affect their other children. Phil has been working with Mike for the last two and a half years. In this time, Mike has received peer support, vocational skills training, substance use support, and counselling for his illness and his familial dynamic.</p>
                            <p>Mike is turning 18 in six months, and Phil is responsible for helping him enter into adult mental health and addiction services.Mike is currently studying for his GED and will take the test in eight months, after he is discharged from services. Over the last few months, tensions with his parents have escalated. His parents don’t understand his illness and how it affects him. Moreover, their fears of his illness affecting their other children are increasing. His parents have even kicked Mike out of the house a few times and he has had to stay at a shelter.</p>
                            <p>Phil starts working on Mike’s discharge and care plan, which will be submitted to his new case manager in adult mental health and addiction services. Phil schedules a discharge/care plan meeting with Mike to gain his input in co-creating his plan.</p>
                            <p>After conducting various assessments and one-on-one counselling sessions, it becomes clear that Mike is at imminent risk of homelessness. Due to the tensions between Mike and his parents, Phil feels it is best that he find more stable housing. As part of his discharge/care plan, Phil identifies that Mike is willing to use emergency housing (a shelter), if necessary. Also, Phil and Mike identify other family members and friends who could fulfill temporary respite needs. Moreover, Phil has made an application for supportive housing, and Mike has been put on the wait list. Because wait lists can be lengthy, Phil completed the application immediately. This is highlighted in Mike’s discharge/care plan so that his new case manager can follow up with his status during his transition to adult care.</p>
                            <p>Working collaboratively, Phil and Mike decide that Mike would continue to benefit from substance use support. He is put on an adult substance use services wait list, which is identified in his discharge/care plan. His discharge/care plan also states that he is working to complete his education to supplement the vocational skills he has acquired over the last couple of years. Phil identifies that the new case manager can continue to support him in his educational accomplishments.</p>
                            <p>Mike identifies a new goal that he wants to see included in his discharge/care plan. He wants to be involved in a day program that promotes and supports peer support groups, psychosocial rehabilitation, vocational skills, life skills, and activities of daily living. Mike identifies that he would like this support to commence after he attains his GED (General Education Diploma). Phil outlines this goal in Mike’s discharge/care plan for his new case manager. Mike is pleased that he is able to contribute to his plan. He feels empowered that he has a say in what happens to him when he transitions into adulthood services.</p>
                            <p>Over the next six months, Phil and Mike meet regularly to update Mike’s progress and to review his discharge/care plan to see if it is still viable or if he would like to make any changes. The week Mike is scheduled to meet his new case manager, Phil suggests that if he is comfortable with the idea, Phil could attend the intake session with him. Mike is relieved to know that someone he has trusted for the past three years will accompany him through this transition. Phil attends the intake with Mike and helps him present his discharge/care plan to his new case manager. Moving forward, Mike will be supported in identifying and articulating his goals as he engages in adult mental health and substance use services.</p>

                            <a href="#" id="page-238" class="ch-link"></a>The social determinants of health are important in maintaining strong mental health. This is particularly true for Indigenous peoples. Historical determinants such as the residential schools legacy also play an important role in Indigenous mental health. An Aboriginal Healing Foundation survey found that 75 percent of residential school survivors had received a mental health diagnosis, the most prevalent being post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and major depression (Research Series, 2003). Thirty percent of First Nations people have experienced depressive symptoms for two or more weeks (First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey, 2005), and suicide and self-inflicted injuries are the leading causes of death for First Nations youth and adults up to 44 years of age (Health Canada, 2003).</p>
                        <p>Non-Indigenous social workers must be sensitive to the cultural values and perspectives of Indigenous peoples; similarly, First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people acknowledge the diversity of practices and values among other Indigenous people in different regions of the country. Just as there are no pan-Canadian Indigenous world views, there is no uniform understanding of mental health and wellness on the part of Indigenous peoples.</p>
                        <p>The First Nations and Inuit Health Branch of Health Canada and the Assembly of First Nations have jointly developed the First Nations Mental Wellness Continuum Framework. In this model, cultural values and sacred knowledge are understood as intrinsic ways of living with the land, which provides for the “good life,” or Mino-pimatasiwin.</p>
                        <p>The model emphasizes purpose, hope, meaning, and belonging: “Mental wellness is a balance of the mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional. This balance is enriched as individuals have purpose in their daily lives, whether it is through education, employment, care-giving activities, or cultural ways of being and doing; hope for their future and those of their families that is grounded in a sense of identity, unique Indigenous values, and having a belief in spirit; a sense of belonging and connectedness within their families, to community, and to culture; and, finally, a sense of meaning and an understanding of how their lives and those of their families and communities are part of creation and a rich history” (www.hc-sc.gic.ca).</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold--grey">Holistic Wellness</p>
                        <p>Many Indigenous communities draw on this model to develop a holistic wellness framework. The Wet’suwet’en people in northern British Columbia have embraced the concept of “Yinta,” meaning “people connected to the land.” This concept is embodied by the statement, “We are the land and the land is us.” Five key related themes are 1) Being Seen/Being Heard; 2) <span class="text--bold text--bold--grey background--span-color">Hiltus</span> (Strengths); 3) Spirituality; 4) Sustainable Livelihood; and 5) Social Responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Indigenous peoples have experienced lifelong intergenerational trauma, and social workers must ensure that their services do not recreate or reproduce structural violence. In Donna’s story, Donna’s reconnection with the land eventually provided a “breakthrough” in her recovery when her social worker recognized the validity of adopting practices based on complementary approaches, cultural competence, and cultural safety.</p>

                                <a href="#" id="page-239" class="ch-link"></a>Building on strengths-based, solutions-focused, multicultural counselling can enhance cultural competence for non-Aboriginal social workers working with Aboriginal clients.</p>
                            <p>Donna is a 45-year-old First Nations woman living in a small urban community. A single parent to two sons, aged 10 and 14, she has been sober for seven years. She worked for the local health authority for five years and is currently employed as an Aboriginal educator and liaison worker. Her children attend the local school and are involved in youth soccer. The children have some contact with their father, but his sobriety is transitory.</p>
                            <p>Donna has recently accessed a community counselling agency, presenting with work stress that has been exacerbated by her sister Carlie’s recent death from a drug overdose. Donna is having more frequent intrusive thoughts about drinking, and she is worried about losing her sobriety.</p>
                            <p>Initially, Donna’s social worker adopted a strengths-based approach using a number of CBT techniques. These included reviewing Donna’s supports for sobriety, finding ways to reduce her work-related stress, particularly through reframing techniques (reducing her self-expectations), and reaching out for family support to facilitate some of her sons’ extra-curricular activities. Although a referral to a physician for antidepressants was discussed, Donna was reluctant to use psychotropic medication. After six counselling sessions, Donna had not experienced any relief, and if anything, her anxiety and depression were increasing. When she wasn’t working, she stayed in her pajamas and lay in bed. She was isolating herself from her friends and family, and experienced a setback when she went on a weekend drinking binge. Her 14-year-old was beginning to act out, and she had a call from the school because he had been in a fight, which was unusual for him.</p>
                            <p>It was time for the social worker to reconsider her interventions with Donna. Trust had been built, but the question of whether the approach was working had to be re-evaluated. Troubling questions as to whether Donna was being retraumatized through structural violence emerged for the social worker. At the next session, the social worker returned to Donna’s presenting problem, which was work stress. This provided an opportunity for Donna to reflect on the difficulties of integrating the demands of employment in a health bureaucracy with her own needs and those of the Aboriginal clients with whom she worked. This opportunity for reflection allowed the social worker to raise the question of whether the approach to counselling had been effective. Donna liked the social worker and didn’t want to offend her, but she acknowledged that the sessions were not helping. This honest appraisal opened the possibility of working more “with” each other, and exploring a more holistic wellness model.</p>
                            <p>A pivotal question to ponder was what gave Donna strength and energy? What replenished her? And what had she done over the years to overcome the significant adversities she had experienced? After a long silence, Donna started talking about her need to find time to walk outside, away from the concrete buildings. She recalled the peace she had felt as a child sitting beside a creek just outside her village. As she talked more about this memory, her energy lifted and she became brighter. She concluded the session with the worker by announcing a commitment to take a week off from work to return to her village and reconnect with her community. She saw this retreat as a way of honouring her deceased sister as well. Donna developed a solid plan that promised to be a strengthening journey for herself, rather than a journey to support others.</p>
                            <p>Two weeks later, Donna came back to see her counsellor. She was back to work and looked much better. During her time away, she had walked endlessly in the woods with no direction. One day, she was sitting by the creek and two eagles circled overhead, eventually swooping down as if watching her. She felt the presence of her sister and her mother, and she knew her sister was being cared for again.</p>
                            <p>Although Donna came in for support periodically after her time away, a turning point had occurred. She found more ways to connect with nature, at least on weekends, and she reconnected with her spirituality more frequently as well. Donna continued to teach her social worker about holistic wellness and the importance of listening and accepting a different world view, one that avoided reinforcing structural violence.</p>

                            <p>As a child, I always knew that when I grew up, I wanted to help people. At the age of 21, fresh out of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology with an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in Criminology, I landed a job as a mental health worker with the Canadian Mental Health Association. Based at Partnership Place, a clubhouse in Brampton, Ontario, my job involved organizing social, vocational, skills-based, and daily living activities for adults with mental health issues. My background in criminology provided me with a strong rehabilitative perspective&mdash;I viewed my clients holistically rather than in terms of labels, and I believed that they were all capable of getting better.</p>
                            <p>I left that job to work for the Peel Halton Dufferin Acquired Brain Injury Services. As a team leader, I oversaw programming for individuals with either dual diagnosis or acquired brain injuries&mdash;the latter involving high medical or behavioural needs&mdash;and the families of these individuals. I was responsible for behaviour management programs related to personal care activities, as well as for the integration of individuals in a supported living environment into the broader community.</p>
                            <p>Currently, I am a family support worker with the Family Association for Mental Health Everywhere (FAME). I provide direct support to families in which one or more members are affected by a mental health issue. This work is unique because there are few resources available for family members struggling to support a loved one who is experiencing a mental health problem. Families are an integral part of an individual&rsquo;s recovery process, but they often feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead, and they need guidance and reassurance.</p>
                            <p>Using print and online materials, I help educate families about mental illness&mdash;its origins, symptoms, and treatment. I also help families develop communication strategies, coping strategies, and self-care strategies. I provide counselling to individuals, families, and groups. Families often experience burnout, and they need a safe environment in which they can vent their frustrations and learn that they are not facing an uncertain future&#160;alone.</p>
                            <p>Cultural sensitivity is an important aspect of the work that I do. Mental health is viewed differently across diverse cultures, genders, religions, ages, and abilities. People from some cultures perceive mental illness as a &ldquo;disgrace,&rdquo; and they need help in reframing their attitudes so that their illness does not cause them to feel diminished as human beings. Coping strategies differ from culture to culture as well. Being able to understand each family&rsquo;s unique situation and cultural context, and to adapt my working style accordingly, is an absolute necessity in the work that I do each day.</p>
                            <p>Staying informed about resources in the community is also essential, as I help families navigate an often confusing mental health system. I maintain a caseload that continues to grow; time management and organizational skills are therefore key.</p>
                            <p>Community outreach is another vital aspect of my job. I give presentations about mental health and the importance of family support to schools, seniors&rsquo; groups, hospitals, police associations, and other agencies.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes conversations with family members can be emotionally draining, as their dilemmas are often complex and distressing. Because I run a small satellite office on my own in Brampton, Ontario, I frequently debrief with co-workers either by phone or in our monthly team meetings.</p>
                            <p>When a person who has been ill finally receives a diagnosis, accepts therapy and/or medication, and learns to manage their symptoms, I celebrate those &ldquo;mini-milestones&rdquo; with the individual and his or her family. Seeing families progress from crises to more stable relationships is very rewarding and gives me hope. Nothing is more fulfilling than when a client tells me at the end of a session, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how much you have helped me.&rdquo; At the end of the day, if I have had a positive influence on one family, I&rsquo;ve done my job. The reason I chose social work as a profession was to make a change. And change happens one person at a time.</p>
