It is also a country that tends to be highly accepting of cultural diversity, and the majority of Canadians pride themselves on that fact. Each new wave of immigrants adds to the richness of the Canadian way of life. Immigrants make positive contributions to our nation’s economy, and they help to define us. Canada is, as has often been said, a mosaic rather than a melting pot.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be taken for granted, however. The formal acceptance of racial and cultural diversity can be contrasted with the fact that many racialized minorities report that they frequently experience discrimination and unfair treatment. Perhaps nowhere was this more evident than during the 2015 federal election when the Conservative Party sought, unsuccessfully, to focus attention on so-called culturally barbaric practices and Muslim women in Canada who chose to wear the niqab.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-310"></a>Most Canadians take great pride in the ethnic and racial diversity of their country. Indeed, in comparison to many other countries, there is much to feel good about. However, we need not look too far back into Canadian history to see that ethnic conflict and racism are not completely foreign to the Canadian experience. Moreover, problems in this area continue to the present day.</p>
                    <p><span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-1">Racism</span> persists and even thrives in Canada, according to Lincoln Alexander (1922&ndash;2012), a former lieutenant governor of Ontario, former chair of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, and the first Black member of Parliament:</p>
                    <p>As Canadians, we are not doing a very good job. We&rsquo;re not making the grade. We get a failing grade when police officers in Saskatoon drive Aboriginal men to the outskirts of town and leave them in sub-zero temperatures without winter coats. We get a failing grade when 600 Chinese [citizens] arrive by ships off the coast of British Columbia looking for sanctuary in Canada only to be met with fear and even hatred. . . . We get a failing grade when our schoolyards become a war zone for some visible minority youth because they&rsquo;re bullied on a regular basis, sometimes with fatal results. We get a failing grade when new immigrants, especially non-white immigrants,. . . subsidize Canada&rsquo;s economy to the tune of 55 billion dollars each year. . . because skills acquired in their homelands are not recognized in this country (Alexander, 2001).</p>
                    <p>To begin with, then, let us briefly review the historical background that contributed to this troubling state of affairs. (For an exploration of the tensions between Aboriginal peoples and the dominant white Canadian culture, see Chapter 9.)</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Chinese Immigration and the Head Tax</p>
                    <p>Between 1881 and 1884, some 15,700 Chinese workers were brought to Canada from China to work as contract labourers on the Canadian Pacific Railway (Isajiw, 1999). After its completion, however, a series of laws were put in place to exclude or limit the number of Chinese and South Asian immigrants to Canada: the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885; <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-2">the head tax</span> of $50 on Chinese immigrants set in 1885 (raised to $100 in 1901 and to $500 in 1904, an average two-year wage for a Chinese person in Canada); the Immigration Act of 1910 (which established &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; classes of immigrants); and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923 (which admitted to Canada only certain specified classes of Chinese people and almost stopped Chinese immigration completely). William Lyon Mackenzie King, then deputy minister of labour, claimed in 1907 that it was &ldquo;natural that Canada should remain a white man&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>The head tax was eliminated in 1923, but other laws, that made it nearly impossible for Chinese men to bring their families to Canada and forced many to be separated from their wives and children for years at a time, remained in place until 1947. In 2000, the Canadian government was faced with a lawsuit by Chinese Canadians demanding compensation for the head tax and other racially motivated measures aimed at limiting immigration from China in the first half of the twentieth century; however, it was unsuccessful.</p>
                    <p>In 2005, the federal government signed a $2.5 million deal with the National Congress of Chinese Canadians and 14 other Chinese-Canadian groups to set up education projects to commemorate those who had paid the tax. On June 22, 2006, Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper formally apologized in Parliament for the head tax.</p><!-- start aside -->

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-312"></a>During World War I and World War II, the Canadian government instituted a policy of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-4">internment</span> of members of ethnic minority groups whom it defined as &ldquo;enemy aliens.&rdquo; Immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with which the Allies were at war, were relocated to prison camps in World War I. For the same reason, Japanese Canadians were uprooted from their homes and held in similar camps during World War II. In both cases, the basic human rights of these minority groups were violated. During World War II, the homes, businesses, and property of Japanese Canadians were confiscated, and their lives were turned on end (Isajiw, 1999).</p>
                    <p>Many historians claim that the forced eviction of Japanese Canadians from the Pacific Coast in early 1942 was the greatest mass movement in the history of Canada. It was not until 1949, four years after Japan had surrendered, that the majority of displaced Japanese Canadians were allowed to return to British Columbia. By then, most had begun new lives elsewhere in Canada. It took more than four decades, until 1988, for the Canadian government to announce a comprehensive settlement with surviving members of the Japanese wartime community. It also formally apologized. Japanese Canadians and the government announced compensation packages that included $21,000 for each individual directly wronged during this period.</p><!-- start aside -->

                        <p class="text--caption">Today, Canada is a country that prides itself on its multiculturalism and ethnic diversity. But in the 1960s, a different attitude was evidenced by a community named Africville in the north end of Halifax.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">Africville was the result of segregation: not only were its Black residents separated from the white residents of Halifax, but their community was also on the outskirts of town.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">To add insult to injury, between 1964 and 1969 Africville was bulldozed for expansion. Houses were demolished, and residents scattered.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">In 2010, Halifax mayor Peter Kelly apologized to former residents of Africville and their families, and committed the city to rebuilding the Seaview Baptist United Church, which had been the focal point of Africville.

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-313"></a>The first account of the presence of Black people in Canada was in 1605. Mathieu da Costa, a Black man, is reported to have been travelling with the French explorers who landed in Nova Scotia (formerly Port Royal) in that year. Later, the French brought Black slaves to Canada. Slavery was officially introduced in Canada by the French in 1628 and was continued by the British until 1833&ndash;1834, when it was abolished throughout the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>The next significant migration was that of the &ldquo;Black Loyalists,&rdquo; who arrived in Nova Scotia in 1784 following the American War of Independence. Hundreds of Black people who had fought for their freedom on the side of the British against the Americans were brought to Nova Scotia. They were emancipated and were promised education, employment, and citizenship, but were essentially left to fend for themselves. Many were forced back into slavery through abject poverty. The situation forced them to ask the British government in England to send them to Africa, and in the late 1790s, many of them were shipped to the British colony of Sierra Leone. In response to the need for cheap labour, however, the British deceived and brought Maroons (runaway slaves) from Jamaica to work on the fortifications at Citadel Hill in Halifax. The Maroons refused to be controlled as slaves by white Nova Scotians, who used them as forced labourers. Many were also shipped to Sierra Leone (Mensah, 2010; Walker, 1995). Another group of Black people taken to Nova Scotia consisted of refugees from the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. Most Black Nova Scotians are descendants of these refugees. Between 1820 and 1860, Black people used what is known as the Underground Railroad to escape slavery in the United States. As fugitives, slaves, and freedmen, they formed sizable settlements, particularly in southwestern Ontario and the Maritimes. More recently, immigration from the Caribbean and Africa has accounted for the majority of Black Canadians.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Anti-Black Racism</p>
                    <p>The existence in Canada of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-5">anti-Black racism,</span> racism toward Black people, should not be minimized. Canada actively practised slavery until the nineteenth century (Sheppard, 1997). Even the Black Loyalists who entered Canada as free persons were subject to racist policies. Black Canadians were subject to legislation that enforced segregated schools and communities and that limited property rights. In 1939, Canada&rsquo;s highest court found that racial discrimination was legally enforceable (Walker, 1997). Not until 1953&ndash;1954 did Canada delete from its statutes discriminatory laws that denied Black citizens the right to pursue formal education, respectable jobs, welfare assistance, and civil and humanitarian rights.</p>
                    <p>Despite this progress, many reports documenting the continuation of anti-Black racism suggest that much of the behaviour is not a matter of isolated events but is instead a systemic issue. According to Frances Henry, relations between police and the Black community have been &ldquo;fraught with tensions&rdquo; (1994). Similar conclusions were reached by the Commission on Systemic Racism in the Ontario Criminal Justice System (1995), which reported that discriminatory practices by police against Black men were widespread.</p>
                    <p>Many Black persons have shared their experiences of being stopped and questioned by the police while engaging in normal daily activities, such as driving or going to a movie theatre. The expression &ldquo;driving while Black&rdquo; emerged to describe this pattern of racial profiling of Black people. As well, James et al. (2010) provide many examples of how police officers in Halifax, Toronto, and Calgary negatively view Black men, which in turn shapes their regular dealings with this group of citizens.</p><!-- start aside -->

                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-315"></a>For the May 2015 issue of <span>Toronto Life</span>, Desmond Cole, a writer for <span>Torontoist</span>, a project coordinator for City Vote Ontario, and a political commentator, wrote an article that completely shattered the notion of Canadian society as being “colour-blind.”</p>
                                        <p>The centrepiece of the article is Cole’s exposé of “carding,” an overt police practice of stopping people—disproportionately Black people—on the street and collecting information about them. These innocent individuals have committed no crimes. The information gathered by the police is kept in a secret database, presumably for future reference.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Prevalence of Anti-Black Racism</p>
                                        <p>Cole’s exposé addresses a critical question for social workers who work with African Canadians and individuals from diverse racial communities: What is the impact of living in a society where racism and other forms of oppression prevail? Under sustained pressure from residents, community groups, and legal experts, the practice of carding has now been put on “pause,” although this was never announced publicly.</p>
                                        <p>As a third-generation African-Canadian male, I was not surprised by the contents of Cole’s insightful writing. I have witnessed racism in virtually all sectors of Canadian society, as well as being the recipient myself of both subtle and overt forms of discrimination. Anti-Black racism has roots that date back to when people of African descent first arrived and settled in what eventually became the country of Canada.</p>
                                        <p>Cole presents a consistent theme—that Black people and others experience racial profiling on a regular basis. It is imposed not only by police services but by an array of other major societal institutions as well. He noted in 2013 that 25 percent of the people carded in Toronto were Black. “At the time,” he remarks, “I was 17 times more likely than a white person to be carded in Toronto’s downtown core.”</p>
                                        <p>For Cole, the practice of carding is just one indicator of the systemic bias in Canada’s justice system in relation to Black men and other racialized minorities. “Between 2009 and 2013,” he states, “fifteen percent of Black male inmates were assigned to maximum security, compared to 10 percent overall.” And racial bias is not limited to African Canadians. Today, 25 percent of inmates in federal prisons are of Indigenous descent, and the proportion is much higher for incarcerated females and for inmates in provincial jails.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A Role for Practitioners and Social Work Agencies</p>
                                        <p>Racism and discrimination leave a deep scar on the emotional, psychological, and physical health of those on the receiving end (James et al., 2010). Cole recalls his own family being stopped by a white policeman when he threw an item from his father’s car. The officer informed Cole and the rest of the family that they would need to watch their behaviour, as any future infraction could result in being stopped and interrogated by the police at will.</p>
                                        <p>Given the deep, harmful effects of racism (which can be short or long term), social work practitioners have a professional responsibility to combat this type of oppression. At the micro level, they will likely find themselves working with African Canadians who experience this form of trauma.</p>
                                        <p>At the macro level, it is imperative that social workers be in the forefront of advocating that the streets and our workplaces are free from racism and other types of oppression. This includes advocating that the agencies that we, as social workers, work for “walk the talk” and are themselves anti-racist entities, combatting racism wherever and whenever it appears.</p>

                        <p class="text--caption">In 1971, Canada became the first country to adopt multiculturalism as an official policy. The policy aimed to create a more integrated Canadian society by providing our diverse ethnic minority groups with a sense of belonging to Canada.</p>
                        <p class="text--caption">In 1988, the Multiculturalism Act was passed, restating and reinforcing the 1971 policy and mandating that federal departments ensure equal opportunities in employment for all ethnic and racial groups. In order to implement the policy, the Canadian government created the Multicultural Directorate, which in turn developed a range of programs designed to help it fulfill the policy&rsquo;s objectives.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-316"></a>As might be expected in a country comprised largely of immigrants and their descendants, ethnic and race relations in Canada have been heavily influenced by <span class="span--keyword text--red span--keyword" id="kc-6">immigration policy.</span> Prior to 1967, when important new immigration legislation came into force, &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; was the main criterion for admission to Canada. Canadian immigration policy was undoubtedly Eurocentric&mdash;immigration was encouraged from white Europe and discouraged from the rest of the world. In 1967, new legislation introduced a system of <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-7">immigration classes</span> known as the &ldquo;point system,&rdquo; whereby prospective immigrants had to qualify based on such criteria as education, work experience, language fluency, and age. &ldquo;Country of origin&rdquo; was no longer an explicit criterion in the selection process. The inevitable consequence of the new legislation was a new wave of skilled immigrants from Asia, Africa, and South and Central America.</p>
                    <p>The shift was dramatic. Prior to 1961, over 90 percent of all immigrants were from Europe, and over half of these were from Northern and Western Europe and the United Kingdom. Immigrants from Asia made up only a small percentage (3.1 percent) of all immigrants arriving in the country. By the 1990s, however, Europeans made up only about one fifth of all immigrants, while the largest number, close to 60 percent, came from Asia. The remaining proportion (16.6 percent) came from Central and South America, the Caribbean and Bermuda, and the United States. In addition, the largest proportion of European immigrants came not from the United Kingdom or Northern and Western Europe, but from Eastern Europe. (See Figure 10.1.)</p>
                    <p>According to the 2011 National Household Survey (NHS), in that year Canada had about 6,775,800 foreign-born individuals (Statistics Canada, 2011). They represented 26.6 percent of the total population, compared with 19.8 percent in 2006. In 2013, Canada admitted 258,953 permanent residents (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2013a). The top three source countries in 2013 were the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, India, and the Philippines. The proportion of the three major immigration classes was as follows: 51.2 percent were economic immigrants (along with their spouse/partner and dependants); 31.6 percent were in the family class; and 11.2 percent were protected persons and others.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">&ldquo;Visible Minorities&rdquo;&mdash;An Outmoded Term</p>
                    <p>With this shift in immigration came a substantial increase in the so-called visible minority population in Canada. Although this term is still widely used in government circles, it has rightly come under criticism, even by outside organizations such as the United Nations. Many argue that the term <span class="span--keyword text--red span--keyword" id="kc-8">&ldquo;racialized minorities&rdquo;</span> or <span class="span--keyword text--red">&rdquo;racialized groups&rdquo;</span> is preferable, since these terms make clear that race is not a biological concept but a socially constructed one. Furthermore, the term &ldquo;visible minority&rdquo; supports a practice whereby non-white groups are categorized almost solely by race, whereas white groups are not.</p>
                    <p>In 2011, the racialized population in Canada was approximately 6,264,800 (Statistics Canada, 2011), or 19.1 percent of the total population. Of these, 30.9 percent were born in Canada, and 65.1 percent were born outside the country. A small percentage (4 percent) were non-permanent. The three largest racialized groups&mdash;South Asians, Chinese, and Blacks&mdash;represented 61.3 percent of the racialized population. The vast majority lived in Ontario, British Columbia, Qu&eacute;bec, and Alberta. Seven out of ten lived in Toronto, Montr&eacute;al, or Vancouver.</p>
                    <p>Statistics Canada projects that by 2017, one half of all racialized minorities in Canada will be South Asian or Chinese and that the size of each group will be around 1.8 million.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-317"></a>It is anticipated that the racialized population of Canada will continue to rise as a percentage of the total Canadian population. For example, the Black population is expected to reach one million by 2017. The groups that are expected to grow the fastest are the West Asian, Korean, and Arab communities. According to most projections, the size of each of these groups will more than double (Belanger and Malenfant, 2005).</p>
                    <p>The substantial increase in the racialized population in recent years has already affected public policy (e.g., multiculturalism and anti-racism policy) and will continue to do so. This increase in our ethnic and racial diversity has enriched Canada and the lives of its citizens, and the demographic changes need not result in ethnic and racial conflict. However, other factors, such as a serious downturn in the economy, and policies and institutional procedures that intervene and foster ethnic and racial divisions, may affect the social impact of this underlying demographic change. As a result, social workers and other front-line workers face a new set of issues today. They need to be sensitive to religious and cultural differences within the populations they serve. They also need to deal directly with the damaging effects of discrimination and racism on the personal well-being of their clients.</p><!-- start aside -->

There is a growing consensus about the need for consistent and firm policy responses from the criminal justice system at all levels.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Canadian Human Rights Legislation</p>
                    <p>National human rights legislation in Canada began with the passage of the Canadian Bill of Rights in 1960. Later in that decade, provinces enacted similar legislation, and by 1975 all provinces in Canada had human rights codes. In general, both federal and provincial human rights law prohibits the dissemination of hate propaganda and discrimination in all aspects of employment, the leasing and sale of property, public accommodation, services and facilities, and membership in labour unions and professional associations. Grounds of discrimination vary slightly depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>In 1982, the Canadian Bill of Rights was superseded by the <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-10">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</span> The Charter guarantees the fundamental freedoms of conscience and religion, thought, belief, opinion and expression (including freedom of the press and other media), and peaceful assembly and association. It guarantees democratic rights, geographical mobility rights, legal rights (including the right to life, liberty, and security of person), and equality rights that protect against &ldquo;discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.&rdquo; The Charter also reinforces official bilingualism in Canada by affirming the equality of the English and French languages and by affirming the rights of children to be educated in either language. It also affirms the multicultural character of Canada and recognizes the rights of Canada&rsquo;s Indigenous peoples. Finally, it emphasizes that all the rights and freedoms are guaranteed equally to male and female&#160;persons.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Police-Reported Hate Crimes in Canada</p>
                    <p>Passing laws is one thing; implementing them is another, however. All the provinces and territories and the federal government have human rights commissions charged with addressing human rights abuses. While these commissions have had some success, they have unfortunately often been hampered by limited resources and case backlogs. Furthermore, since such commissions are by their nature complaints-driven, it is generally felt that many victims of discrimination, perhaps because they are new to the country, do not have the financial resources or even the time to report discrimination and initiate the lengthy complaints process.</p>
                    <p>Our information on the extent of hate crimes comes only from anecdotal evidence and official police reports. For example, in 2013, the police reported 1,167 criminal incidents that were motivated by hate. Approximately half (51 percent) were motivated by hatred of a race or ethnic group. Another 28 percent were motivated by hatred of religion, and 16 percent were motivated by hatred of an individual&rsquo;s sexual orientation (Allen, 2015). (See Figure 10.2.)</p>
                    <p>With regard to hate crimes related to race or ethnicity, Black populations were the most frequently targeted (22 percent) in 2013. Of religion-motivated hate crimes, those targeting Jewish populations were the most common (16 percent). Four in ten (40 percent) police-reported hate crimes in 2013 involved violent offences, such as assault, uttering threats, and criminal harassment. Overall, the number of violent hate crimes increased 4 percent from the previous year, driven by increases in common assault and uttering threats.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-319"></a>The federal government demonstrated strong leadership in combatting hate crimes by amending the Criminal Code in 1996 to strengthen sentencing for any offence that is motivated by hate (Bill C-41). The move prompted community discussion, raised overall awareness of the issues, and helped to mobilize communities. It also highlighted the need for stronger responses in cases in which hate-motivated incidents occur and may go unreported.</p>
                    <p>For their part, front-line social workers are using innovative anti-racist approaches that emphasize community empowerment to combat hate crimes. Since hate crimes do not occur in a vacuum, education and community work can help prevent them and act as an important complement to hate crime laws. Social workers are involved in outreach and consultation, education, and awareness activities and in fostering the creation of advocacy and support groups. In struggling against overt racism of this kind, social workers also work closely with community organizations to promote an anti-racist perspective through education. This may involve producing brochures on anti-racism, going into schools and engaging students on the issues, or speaking out about adverse community conditions and the need for government action on unsatisfactory living conditions.</p>
                    <p>With their roots firmly in the locality, social workers and other community workers can also provide feedback on what works and what does not. This kind of collaborative, community-based approach to combatting overt racism can go a long way in helping to minimize the extent of hate-crime activity and to strengthen the resolve and solidarity of its victims. Hate-motivated crimes will not go away on their own&mdash;they need to be addressed head on, not only by those immediately affected but by all those who oppose such acts.</p><!-- start aside -->

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-320"></a>Canadian social workers play an indispensable role in the immigrant resettlement process at all levels. They not only provide direct support to the immigrants themselves, but also help create the broader conditions for their successful integration into Canadian society. A strong knowledge of immigration policy and recent shifts in this area is, therefore, essential.</p>
                    <p>Three issues that have risen to the surface in recent years that are likely to affect directly the kinds of work practitioners do with clients deserve special mention: skills recognition, family reunification backlogs, and Canada’s foreign worker program.</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Foreign Education and Skills Recognition</p>
                    <p>Historically, Canada’s immigration policy has centred on attracting persons who are highly skilled and highly educated and who ultimately can contribute to the nation’s economic growth. Many immigrants make the decision to leave their home countries with aspirations of living the “Canadian Dream,” a chance at a better life with more opportunities. Unfortunately, the reality for highly skilled individuals is often closer to a “Canadian Nightmare” because their skills are often neither recognized nor valued. Many have no recourse but to accept lower-skilled, lower-paying jobs. This is known as underemployment. There is, according to Bhandari, Horvath, and To (2006), an underlying problem with an immigration policy that awards points based on education and skills if these skills are not ultimately valued as “Canadian experience.” The result is what we see—namely, a lack of recognition of foreign credentials and experience (Guo, 2009; Ngo and Este, 2006; Wayland, 2006).</p>
                    <p>The lack of consistent, transparent, and fair assessment practices in relation to occupational and academic credentials is consistently identified in the literature as a major stumbling block for immigrants. Racism and other forms of discrimination also play a part—research consistently shows that newcomers often experience both subtle and direct forms of racism (Esses et al., 2007; Guo, 2009; Ighadaro, 2006). In addition, there is often an automatic assumption, not based on fact, that all foreign credentials are not up to Canadian standards and that therefore immigrant professionals must be required to upgrade their education if they want to work in positions that match their education level (Ngo and Este, 2006). That there would be such a problem likely did not even occur to these professionals when they first applied to immigrate to Canada. As a result, many qualified newcomers are not able to contribute fully to the Canadian economy and society, with all the accompanying hardships for them and their families.</p>
                    <p>What does this mean for the individual social worker? Many immigrant professionals are severely affected emotionally and financially by the lack of recognition of their prior educational achievements and previous work experience. Social workers must be able to provide the necessary information and support services to help guide them through this difficult period. In January 2016, the Government of Canada announced that it would invest $50 million over the next two years to develop a framework to speed up the assessment and recognition of foreign credentials.</p>
                    <p>Just as important, it is necessary to advocate on behalf of such newcomers—for example, with governments, professional associations, educational institutions, and employers. Such advocacy can address systemic and structural obstacles that prevent immigrant professionals and their families from seeking out jobs for which they are qualified so that they can begin to make a real contribution to Canadian society.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Family Reunification Backlogs and Delays</p>
                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-321"></a>Although parents and grandparents make up only a small portion of immigrants in the family class (six to eight percent of all immigrants), this group continues to be the focus of Canadian policy debates. This is because the processing for <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-11">family reunification</span> is extraordinarily slow.</p>
                    <p>For refugees entering Canada, family reunification delays can be especially stressful:</p>
                    <ul class="ul--list">
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Long delays increase risks to family members overseas in conflict zones or refugee camps.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Living conditions may endanger the health of family members and affect children’s education, leading to increased social costs when they finally come to Canada.</li>
                        <li class="li--bullet-item">Long separations exact a heavy psychological toll. Prolonged family separation has its most negative impacts on children.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It seems obvious that people with relatives in Canada will be better able to settle here and contribute to Canadian society. Yet many children wait over two years before being able to reunite with their parents in Canada. For refugee families, the wait is 31 months.</p>
                    <p>Fulfulling an election promise, in early 2016 the new Liberal immigration minister, John McCallum, announced an increase to the number of applications the Canadian government would accept from parents and grandparents who want to immigrate to Canada, from 5,000 to 10,000 per year. However, with over 14,000 applications arriving within the first four days of the program in 2016, raising the cap a little still leaves a lot of disappointed families.</p>
                    <p>New approaches are definitely called for. For example, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or IRCC (formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada), introduced an Express Entry program for economic immigrants. For immigrants with a valid job offer, IRCC will process applications within six months. For many professionals working to help immigrants settle in Canada, this has raised the question as to whether families’ reunification applications should not be processed at least as quickly as those for economic immigrants, considering the enormous relief it would bring to the applicants themselves and their Canadian families.</p><!-- start aside -->

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Canadians have recently had their attention drawn to serious problems with the Temporary Foreign Workers Program. Time to fix it.</p>
                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-322"></a>Over the past decade, Canada’s immigration program has shifted significantly from permanent to temporary immigration. In 2008, for the first time, the numbers of Temporary Foreign Workers in Canada exceeded the numbers of Permanent Residents admitted. Since then the number of Temporary Foreign Workers has continued to grow.</p>
                                        <p>This shift represents a radical change for Canada: previously, we were a country that welcomed newcomers on a permanent basis, with most becoming citizens. Immigrants have traditionally been understood to be contributing to building the nation and our communities, not simply contributing their labour. A notable exception to that practice, the expulsion of Chinese labourers after the construction of the railway in the nineteenth century, is a source of national shame. Countries that have developed “guest worker” programs, particularly in Europe, have learned by experience the disadvantages, for workers and for society, of relying on the labour of people who are not permitted to integrate into the community, creating a two-tier society.</p>
                                        <p>The large-scale expansion of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program occurred without broad public discussion. Canadians were not given an opportunity to voice their opinions on the shift toward increased temporary migration, even though it represents a major change in Canadian immigration policy.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Low-Skilled versus High-Skilled Workers</p>
                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-323"></a>The Temporary Foreign Worker Program is made up broadly of two parts. At one end, it provides a convenient way for high-skilled workers to come to Canada: they enjoy certain privileges (such as the right to be accompanied by family) and have avenues to permanent residence should they wish to&#160;stay.</p>
                                        <p>At the other end, the program brings in low-skilled workers, who have very limited rights and usually no chance of obtaining permanent status. The workers are temporary (they have to leave after four years) but the labour needs they are filling are often not temporary.</p>
                                        <p>These longer-term labour shortages being filled by Temporary Foreign Workers may be partly caused by the fact that it has been harder for immigrants willing and able to fill those jobs to come to Canada as permanent residents. Economic immigrants are increasingly selected based on advanced educational and professional qualifications.</p>
                                        <p>When Canada identifies needs for workers in “high-skilled” professions, they are recruited with a clear path to permanent residence, but when we need people to work in food services, in greenhouses or on farms, they are recruited on a temporary basis, without the possibility of ever obtaining permanent status. This is discriminatory.</p>
                                        <p>Another cause of this need for Temporary Foreign Workers is the unwillingness of some Canadian employers to pay wages and offer working conditions that would attract Canadian job seekers.</p>

                                        <p>By any account, the current situation is bad for migrant workers and bad for Canadians.</p>
                                        <p>It is extremely unfortunate that Temporary Foreign Workers have too often been presented recently as if pitted against Canadian workers. The current situation should not be blamed on the migrant workers, on Canadian workers or on specific sectors.</p>
                                        <p>At its root, the problem is a structural one.</p>
                                        <p>Because of their temporary status, migrant workers are extremely vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. While many employers treat them fairly, it is easy for others to underpay them, overcharge them for substandard accommodation and expose them to dangerous working conditions.</p>
                                        <p>There are many documented cases of abuse of these workers across the country. It is difficult for people with only temporary status to complain about mistreatment because they may simply be deported. At its most extreme, the exploitation of Temporary Foreign Workers has placed them in situations of human trafficking.</p>
                                        <p>Having workers who are used and then discarded is bad for society as a whole. It is never good for our communities to have two-tier membership, where some people have limited rights and cannot integrate properly or advance themselves.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Our Own History Teaches Us the Benefits of Permanent Immigration</p>
                                        <p>Throughout Canada’s history, immigrants have started their lives here at the bottom of the ladder and worked their way into essential roles in our society, building businesses, creating culture, founding institutions, becoming political leaders, and raising families.</p>
                                        <p>How many of us would not be here today if, in the past, immigrants considered “low-skilled” were forced to leave Canada after a few years? We should learn from our history about what works and makes the country strong.</p>
                                        <p>While some things have changed in the labour needs in Canada, it remains true that we need people to work in a whole range of jobs, and that people have much more to offer than just their labour. We can only benefit from those contributions if people have a chance to make their permanent home among us, along with their families.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-324"></a>Canada’s Indigenous peoples were here first, and will always deserve first place, but the subsequent history of Canada is one of immigration. Successive waves of newcomers have come to Canada, settled, raised families, and contributed to Canadian society. Given the ongoing need for immigrants, it is highly likely that social workers, especially those who practise in large urban centres, will work with individuals or families from these communities.</p>
                    <p>Canadian social work programs, in recent years, have recognized the need to ensure that social work curriculum is complete with content related to newcomer populations, including immigrants, refugees, and temporary foreign workers. This was underlined in the recently revised Canadian Association for Social Work Education’s Standards for Accreditation at both the B.S.W. and M.S.W. levels. However, several scholars, such as Herberg (1985) and Yan and Chan (2010), have posed this important question: How well are social workers today prepared for working with newcomers?</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Assessing Needs and Advocating on Behalf of Newcomers</p>
                    <p>Effective practice with immigrants begins with a <span class="span--keyword text--red" id="kc-12">needs assessment.</span> This process is continuous, and it is participatory. Essentially, it seeks to understand the client and his/her situation, and sets a framework for how change can be achieved (Coulshed and Orme, 2012).</p>
                    <p>As in other areas of social work practice, it is critical to gain a thorough understanding of process. A useful tool is Drachman’s <span class="span--keyword text--red span--keyword" id="kc-13">Stage-of-Migration Framework.</span>This framework provides key questions that can be used to guide the assessment process with immigrants and their families. The outcomes of this inquiry process provide social workers (in consultation with the particular service users themselves) with clear guidance in determining the types of intervention that may be required to address prevailing concerns.</p>
                    <p>It is also imperative for social workers to be knowledgeable about the various kinds of challenges that immigrants experience in their efforts to settle and adapt to life in Canada. Some of these issues include language barriers, underemployment, unfamiliarity with the different systems available to them (such as education, health, and social services), lack of support, role reversals and family conflict, and, for some, making the transition from living in rural environments to large urban centres.</p>
                    <p>Quite frequently, and understandably, newcomers are simply not aware of what services may be available or which ones they are eligible for when they first arrive. Hence, being informed and being able to provide information, and following up on it with them, is critical when assisting immigrants in settling in and fully intergrating into mainstream Canadian society. Another important role is serving as brokers on behalf of new immigrants. This includes contributing to the development of programs and services that facilitate the settlement process.</p>

                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-red">Why Canada should take in many more refugees</p>
                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-326">The Syrian conflict</a> has triggered the world’s largest humanitarian crisis since World War II. In March 2011, civil war began in Syria and has not stopped since. Five years later, Syrians are becoming increasingly vulnerable as their savings are depleted and their assets liquidated. Half of the population is now dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>
                                        <p>Eight million people are displaced within the country and over four million have fled. Shocking images in the media have revealed desperate scenes of families who have lost their loved ones. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 75 percent of Syrians were living in poverty, as of March 15, 2015. Of this percentage, 55 percent are unable to access basic food and non-food items for survival. Twenty percent living in active conflict zones face abject poverty and are facing starvation and malnutrition.</p>
                                        <p>The crisis intensified during Canada’s 2015 federal election, giving party leaders and Canadians ample opportunities to voice opinions. Some seized the opportunity to try to instill fear in the Canadian public—that the refugees would bring terrorism to Canada. The reality is that if you were a potential terrorist looking to gain access to Canada, probably the last way that you would try to gain entry would be as a resettled refugee. It is a long and exhaustive security screening process.</p>
                                        <p>Indeed, such “fear mongering” with security concerns about Syrian refugees plays right into the hands of the terrorists. Halting the resettlement of refugees would likely aid the terror group. Some experts even believe that the Paris terrorist attacks by ISIS in 2015, and similar attacks elsewhere, were attempts to foment hatred toward the Syrian refugees, thereby reinforcing a “them and us” mentality.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">We Need to Do More</p>
                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-327"></a>There are 60 million refugees globally, a number not seen since the end of World War II. The horrifying photos of dead children washing up on European beaches represent only a tiny fraction of the millions suffering in a dozen other conflict zones around the world.</p>
                                        <p>The refugee crisis around the world has been mounting for a decade or more. Now it is at our front door and we need to address it seriously. The previous Conservative government did little by way of bringing in more refugees deserving a place to call their home.</p>
                                        <p>The new federal Liberal government, elected in October 2015, carried through on its commitment to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees to this county. This achievement was significant but it can go further. We need to do more.</p>
                                        <p>“Annually, we are letting in one quarter of one refugee for every 1,000 Canadian citizens,” noted Scott Gilmore in <em>Macleans</em>. “By contrast, Germany is expecting 800,000 new arrivals this year, or 10 per 1,000 citizens. If one compares the economic ability of a country to accept refugees, Canada is accepting one quarter of a refugee per $1 of GDP per capita. Germany is accepting 80 times that amount, or 17.4&#160;refugees&#160;per $1.”</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Combatting Xenophobia</p>
                                        <p>The mayor of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, one of the most high-profile Muslim figures in Canada, confesses that he has been “shaken” by the close-minded, even racist nature of some of the debate over the Syrian refugee crisis. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased since the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. He said he is “very concerned” when Muslims “are asked to apologize for Muslims everywhere.”</p>
                                        <p>The Canadian Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics calls on social workers to act to prevent discrimination based on religion, race, culture, and other factors. Our Code of Ethics also calls on social workers to uphold the right of every person to be free from violence and the threat of violence.</p>
                                        <p>As with the thousands of immigrants and refugees in the past, the task will be to resettle the newcomers from Syria, help them rebuild their lives, and encourage them as they begin to benefit from participation in Canadian society, as so many immigrants before them have done.</p>
                                        <p>Social workers in Canada have a big part to play in that process. Opening up our doors to help out those in need around the globe will go a long way not only to building a stronger Canada but also to bringing stability back to the homelands they left behind.</p>

                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-328"></a>Not long ago, racism was thought to be mainly the result of individual prejudice. Negative stereotypes were deemed to be “the cause” of racist discrimination; if individual attitudes were corrected through education and the sharing of cultures, racism would no longer exist. Much of federal multicultural policy is premised on this understanding.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Fighting Racism at the Personal, Institutional, and&#160;Societal Levels</p>
                                        <p>More recently, in social work and in wider circles, we have seen the emergence of a comprehensive “anti-racist” approach. This has involved a shift from seeing the causes of racism only within personal prejudice and individual behaviour to seeing racism as interlinked with the larger structures and social systems in Canadian society.</p>
                                        <p>Anti-racist social work practice today involves addressing racism at the personal, institutional, and societal levels, separately and simultaneously:</p>
                                        <ul class="ul--list">
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">At the personal level, social workers must ensure that their own practices are free of racism and challenge what are considered to be individual racist practices by others.</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">At the institutional level, social service agencies and other organizations must pursue policies and practices that are non-discriminatory.</li>
                                            <li class="li--bullet-item">At the societal level, legislation and government policies must be changed to remove barriers to racial groups. This includes working to eliminate unintentional racism in policy and procedures.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Community Action and Community Empowerment</p>
                                        <p>Anti-racist social workers and social service workers often use an empowerment approach to elicit the participation of those vulnerable to racism. As one example, the Calgary Bridge Foundation for Youth (CBFY) is a not-for-profit organization that provides settlement services and support to immigrant youth and families in the Calgary region. Since 1990, CBFY has provided a welcoming and inclusive environment for over 12,000 newcomer families each year. It works to strengthen newcomer communities, primarily through the holistic development of immigrant youth by way of year-round programs. Its Afterschool Program, for example, provides opportunities for recreation, academic help, English language learning, and life skills development. The program is delivered at public and Catholic schools, public library branches, and Calgary Housing locations. Additionally, CBFY’s RBC Youth Empowerment Program provides academic support for students in Grades 7 to 12 with varying ELL levels and academic abilities. The program seeks to help students improve their grades, promotes the importance of post-secondary education, develops critical thinking, and builds community-minded individuals, all within a safe and inclusive environment.</p>
                                        <p>When mainstream community services are not fully meeting their needs, minority communities have sometimes seen the need to create their own separate social service agencies to act on their behalf. The Black Community Resource Centre in Montréal, for example, helps Black English-speaking youth and advocates for systemic change. The centre promotes the social, health, education, and economic needs of the youth by collaborating and partnering with Black community organizations, public agencies, and community-wide agencies.</p>
                                        <p>The Black Community Resource Centre works with community organizations to monitor and review public policy that affects Black youth. The Centre attempts to improve the cultural and racial appropriateness of other public and government-funded agencies by organizing cultural and racial sensitivity workshops, and it works with other Black organizations in providing operational support and training. The Centre’s approach is two-pronged: it has created a separate agency to address unmet needs, while also working to improve the cultural appropriateness and anti-racist perspective of mainstream agencies.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Social Workers as Advocates for Racialized Canadians</p>
                                        <p>Anti-racist social work has an important role to play in creating a non-racist society. It demands that practitioners work to examine and perhaps change their own awareness and practices, the practices of those around them, institutional policies and procedures, and social relations and systems that operate, both overtly and covertly, to perpetuate racism.</p>
                                        <p>The implementation of an anti-racist approach requires the employment of workers who have an ability to work across racial divides, and who have an empathy based on knowledge of the differences between people. It also means affirming the core values of being human—respect and dignity for all.</p>
                                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-329"></a>Anti-racist social work practice is a framework for analysis as well as a form of practice pertinent to all aspects of social work, including individual and group counselling, community work, social policy development, and advocacy. It is multi-faceted and relevant for practitioners from all backgrounds.</p>
                                        <p>Below, David Este and Christa Sato, both contribuitors to this chapter, share their own backgrounds and experience working with immigrant, refugee, and racialized Canadians.</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">David Este’s Perspective</p>
                                        <p>“I am a third-generation African Canadian because my grandparents migrated to Canada between 1912 and 1928. They left their respective homes in Antigua and Barbados, settling in Montréal. As I became older, through conversations with my grandparents I cultivated interests in immigration as well as in the history of people of African descent. I completed a Master’s degree in Black Canadian History and then changed focus and became a social worker. Since joining the Faculty of Social Work at the University of Calgary, I have taught courses on social work practice with immigrants and refugees, and in recent years, I have integrated content focused on the health and well-being of people of African descent into my courses.</p>
                                        <p>“During the early years of my academic career, I played an active role in program development for Immigrant Services Calgary, including the Family Mosaic Centre and the Men’s Program (focused on prevention of family violence and settlement issues). I provided a series of professional workshops for staff members and completed a series of program evaluations.</p>
                                        <p>“The majority of my research has focused on immigrants, refugees, and people of African descent residing in Canada. Examples of these studies include the Racism, Violence, and Health Study among people of African descent; New Canadian Children and Youth; and Strengthening Social Services for Immigrants in Calgary. My co-author Christa Sato and I, along with members of our research team in Calgary, are involved in a research study entitled Strength in Unity (SIU). SIU is a community-based project that is attempting to build capacity among youth (males) and men from Asian communities in Canada and to mobilize participants to become Community Mental Health Ambassadors. These individuals are raising awareness about mental illness and health and working in their communities to develop anti-stigma initiatives. The study is being conducted in Vancouver, Toronto, and Calgary, and is led by Dr. Sepali Guruge, who is with the Daphane Cockwell School of Nursing at Ryerson University.”</p>
                                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Christa Sato’s Perspective</p>
                                        <p>“Currently, I am completing a Master’s of Social Work degree at the University of Calgary, specializing in international and community development. My passion for working with immigrant, refugee, and racialized populations emanated from first-hand experiences of social, economic, and cultural barriers encountered by my parents as a result of adapting to life in Canada. These experiences are reflected in my professional experience as a social work practitioner.</p>
                                        <p>“My practicum experiences have been directly related to practice with immigrants and refugees. As a student intern with the City of Calgary, I was involved in community organizing with immigrant and racialized populations in an ethno-culturally diverse neighbourhood in Northeast Calgary. I helped to engage and mobilize residents to discuss and address local needs in their community. During my M.S.W. practicum with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, I was involved with the Local Immigration Partnerships (LIPs). LIPs are community-based partnerships that engage a broad range of local stakeholders to improve accessibility and coordination of services that facilitate immigrant settlement and integration, leading to economic, social, cultural, and civic inclusion of newcomers.</p>
                                        <p>“Finally, over the past two years my professional experience as a research assistant has enabled me to build strong relationships with individuals from different immigrant and ethno-cultural serving agencies from various communities.”</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-330"></a>In 2014 , Canada admitted 48,519 immigrant youth (Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2015). The majority (74 percent) were admitted under the economic class; 12.3 percent arrived as refugees; and 11.7 percent were designated under the family class. The 2011 National Household Survey reported that since 2006, children aged 14 and under accounted for 19.2 percent of the newcomer population and that those aged 15 to 24 accounted for 14.5 percent (Statistics Canada, 2011).</p>
                    <p>As noted by Moreno and Chuang, for immigrant children, &ldquo;schools are the primary institution that facilitates acculturation, socialization and second language acquisition&rdquo; (2011: 239). Immigrant children and youth and their parents may find understanding and adapting to Canada&rsquo;s education system quite challenging. Este and Ngo (2011) maintain that linguistic and cultural barriers, socioe-conomic status, and patterns of acculturation can make it difficult to identify and assess the educational and social needs of immigrant children and youth. The inability to speak either English or French may constitute the most daunting obstacle. Immigrant or refugee students may require between two and five years of explicit English or French language instruction to develop basic communication skills. They need additional time to develop their academic language proficiency through ESL or FSL courses.</p>
                    <p>Those students who have limited education and poor literacy skills require concentrated academic support in order to achieve success in school. As Alejandra&rsquo;s story shows, children and youth who are inappropriately placed in classrooms with children who are several years younger may experience socio-psychological difficulties as a result (Este and Ngo, 2011).</p>
                    <p>Immigrant and refugee youth may experience racism from both teachers and students. It is vital that social work practitioners working in schools undergo anti-racist education and possess the skill set both to prevent racism and to intervene effectively when racist incidents occur. As well, social workers should provide in-service sessions to teachers and school administrators focused not only on what anti-racism is, but on strategies designed to decrease both overt and subtle racism in schools.</p>
                    <p>Social workers can also play important roles in helping parents understand the Canadian education system, including grading, school regulations, and school norms. As part of the assessment of immigrant families, it is critical that social work practitioners gain an understanding of the parents&rsquo; language proficiency as well as their educational attainment. This information may shed light on the academic performance of their children. (To assist in this assessment process, the &ldquo;Assessing Immigrants&rsquo; Needs&rdquo; feature earlier in this chapter will be helpful.)</p>
                    <p>Finally, schools should not adopt a passive stance and simply expect parents to attend parent&ndash;teacher meetings or curricular overviews. If the student&rsquo;s teachers and social worker function closely in tandem, both parties can share information and collaborate to ensure that immigrant and refugee children and youth have opportunities to succeed academically. And as time passes, immigrant and refugee parents can gain a greater understanding not only of the educational institution their child attends but of the broader education system as well.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="grid--full cf">
                        <p class="text--bold"><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-331">Alejandra</a> is a 14-year-old from El Salvador who recently arrived in Calgary with her parents and two younger brothers. After enrolling in a Canadian school for the first time, she appears to slip a little before a social worker intervenes with an assessment and a plan to help get her back on track.</p>
                        <p>When her parents register Alejandra for school in Calgary, the school board assesses her academically and determines that she should be placed in Grade 8. Alejandra is confused as she had already completed Grade 9 back home in El Salvador and had been among the top five percent of students in her school.</p>
                        <p>The school board did not provide a clear reason for her placement, saying only that she had arrived in the middle of the school year and needed to improve her English language skills. Since Alejandra&rsquo;s parents do not speak English fluently, they were unable to question the decision of the school board with regard to Alejandra&rsquo;s placement.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A School Social Worker Intervenes on Alejandra&rsquo;s Behalf</p>
                        <p>After several months, Alejandra&rsquo;s home-room teacher became concerned about her new student. Her grades were below average, and she had missed a number of classes. As well, the teacher observed that she was not involved in any school activities and was struggling to make friends. As a result of these concerns, Alejandra was referred to the in-school social worker.</p>
                        <p>Alejandra agreed to meet with the social worker, who subsequently conducted an assessment focused on her situation. Initially, Alejandra was reluctant to share any information with the social worker because she was afraid that revealing information about her family might impact her family&rsquo;s status in Canada.</p>
                        <p>After a series of meetings with the social worker, Alejandra eventually shared with her that she was bored at school and did not feel challenged. She discussed the significant responsibilities she had taken on as the eldest child since arriving in Canada, including acting as a language broker for her parents, taking care of her younger brothers, and helping them with their homework while her parents worked multiple part-time jobs. Alejandra worries a lot about her parents&rsquo; situation as they are clearly struggling to adjust to life in Canada.</p>
                        <p>In order to help alleviate her parents&rsquo; stress, Alejandra performs household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and maintaining the home. Additionally, she does not feel a social connection with her peers, because they do not seem to understand the ongoing challenges she faces as a newcomer.</p>
                        <p>After processing the information that Alejandra has shared, the school social worker is concerned by the fact that Alejandra is experiencing ongoing high levels of stress and is beginning to show symptoms of depression. The social worker develops the following intervention plan for Alejandra and her family:</p>
                        <ul class="ul--list">
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">meeting with all of Alejandra&rsquo;s teachers to gain a better understanding of (a) her academic performance, and (b)&#160;indicators of her mental health status</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">arranging for a home visit with the goals of (a) sharing the school&rsquo;s concerns related to Alejandra&rsquo;s school performance with her parents; (b) gaining a better understanding of the family&rsquo;s situation; and (c) assessing the family&rsquo;s sources of financial and community support</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">with the family&rsquo;s consent, making a referral for the family to visit a local immigrant-serving agency so that an assessment can be made that is focused specifically on the family&rsquo;s settlement needs</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">working with Alejandra&rsquo;s teachers to develop a viable plan designed to assist her with school work</li>
                            <li class="li--bullet-item">developing an evaluation plan with Alejandra to assess the effectiveness of the intervention plan</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is still too early to evaluate the results of this intervention, but in the social worker&rsquo;s mind, this is not a simple case of a young person having difficulty coping with school work. By addressing Alejandra&rsquo;s home circumstances, engaging with Alejandra&rsquo;s parents, and providing some support and perspective for Alexandra herself, the social worker has increased the likelihood that Alejandra&rsquo;s issues will be temporary and that the situation will gradually normalize for her and her family.</p>

                    <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-332"></a>Social work practice with immigrant and refugee populations is not limited to the first generation. Second-generation children encounter unique challenges, such as struggling for social acceptance, economic opportunity, and equal recognition in mainstream society (Arthur et al., 2008; Dion and Dion, 2004; Gigu&egrave;re et al., 2010; Reitz and Banerjee, 2007). Social workers need to be aware of the ways in which immigration impacts families and communities across generations. As Kobayashi (2008) notes, members of the second generation are agents of sociocultural change, therefore, and a prime locus for understanding the complexities of multicultural society.</p>
                    <p>One particular problem affecting second-generation Canadians of colour is racial discrimination. &ldquo;Second-generation racialized Canadians are keenly aware of the changing nature and forms of racism in Canada,&rdquo; Brooks (2008: 76) asserts, &ldquo;and this knowledge has been gained through stories told by their parents about their experiences of immigration.&rdquo; Research in this area underlines how systemic marginalization and exclusion based on one&rsquo;s race or cultural background is detrimental to creating a sense of belonging (Reitz and Banerjee, 2007; Stewart, 2014). &ldquo;Despite being born in Canada, second-generation Canadians are often tasked with not only overcoming racial barriers within societal structure and institutions, but also proving their Canadian identity&rdquo; (Brooks, 2008: 77). Such exclusion can make second-generation Canadians feel disenfranchised in their place of birth (Kobayashi, 2008).</p>
                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Implications for Social Workers</p>
                    <p>What are the implications of issues affecting second-generation immigrants from a social work practice perspective? First of all, social workers cannot assume that all people from racialized backgrounds are immigrants, for this is clearly not the case. Canadian-born individuals from racialized backgrounds make up a significant portion of the Canadian population. Second, an awareness of the unique issues affecting racialized second-generation Canadians will allow social work practitioners to conduct more thorough assessments. This will put them in a better position to deliver interventions that address the unique needs of this group.</p>
                    <p>In working with second-generation Canadians, it is essential to take into account not only the individual himself or herself, but also the broader family dynamics. Services that emphasize strength and resilience are also critical. These kinds of supports provide individuals, families, and communities with a sense of agency and control. Rather than trying to fit them into either their parents&rsquo; culture or the mainstream Canadian culture, encouraging second-generation Canadians to foster and embrace the duality of their cultures can often be an important step, not only in working toward a more inclusive society but also in creating one that validates and supports the unique needs of these often-neglected groups of Canadians.</p>
                    <p>In Christa&rsquo;s story, Christa, now a practising social worker in Calgary, explains the negative impact of marginalization in her own life. She relates her own personal feelings and experiences and goes on to emphasize the importance of proactive work that addresses the unique needs of second-generation racialized Canadians.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="grid--full cf">
                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-333"></a>A child of immigrant parents, a racialized Canadian, and now a practising social worker, Christa takes up the challenge of advocating with, for, and on behalf of new immigrants, refugees, and racialized populations.</p>
                        <p>As a Canadian-born child of immigrant parents, I can certainly relate to experiences of exclusion based on my ethnicity. One of the most salient forms of racism I encounter on a regular basis is being asked, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; When I say Calgary, I can almost always expect the follow-up question, &ldquo;But where are you really from?&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>While these questions may seem like an innocent indication of curiosity about my cultural background, it implies that as a racialized person, I do not fit conceptualizations of what it means to be truly &ldquo;Canadian.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A Social Work Practice Rooted in Personal Experiences</p>
                        <p>Growing up, I struggled to feel a sense of belonging. Although I could identify with aspects of my mother&rsquo;s Filipino culture, my father&rsquo;s Japanese culture, and the Canadian culture in which I was born, I never truly felt a strong sense of belonging to any of these cultural communities.</p>
                        <p>Nor did any of these ethno-cultural communities truly accept me as an &ldquo;insider.&rdquo; Being born in Canada and being a biracial female has undoubtedly presented challenges in coming to terms with my own ethnic identity.</p>
                        <p>During my childhood and especially during adolescence, I constantly felt competing pressures to meet the cultural and familial expectations of my parents in addition to pressures associated with wanting to fit in with the Canadian mainstream culture. Often, I felt that I could never measure up to these expectations and consequently felt I had either disappointed my parents or did not truly fit in with my Canadian peers.</p>
                        <p>This led to feelings of depression, as well as diminished self-esteem and self-confidence. These detrimental psychological effects manifested themselves as a result of the constant need to prove my Canadian and ethno-cultural identities.</p>
                        <p>After the long and arduous journey of discovering who I am, I have now come to a place where I can feel a sense of pride in my identity as a Canadian-born, racialized female.</p>
                        <p>Attending university and studying social work has enabled me to contextualize my own experiences and to situate them within broader issues related to structural and systemic discrimination. My practice as a social worker, particularly in community-based research with immigrant, refugee, and racialized populations, has been informed by my own experiences of injustice and it positions me to advocate with, for, and on behalf of other marginalized groups.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Creating Change for Others</p>
                        <p>Effective social work practice begins with taking a critical look at your own personal experiences, and using these experiences to address systemic barriers in order to create change for others who may be encountering similar challenges.</p>
                        <p>I can relate to feelings of alienation and dehumanization as a result of having been told that Canada is caring and accepting, despite the fact that people who do not fit the dominant mainstream culture continue to be marginalized and stigmatized. The consequence of such hypocrisies is merely to reproduce prejudice and vulnerabilities across generations.</p>
                        <p>If we deny that such racism occurs, and are unable to speak about it in the public realm openly and honestly, racialized Canadians will continue to be pushed to the margins and left to feel that this marginalization is due to personal and cultural inadequacies.</p>
                        <p>Social workers and others who are working in the health professions have a special role to play in supporting those Canadians who have been marginalized and in combatting discrimination, racism, and injustices wherever they appear.</p>
                        <p>Advocacy is especially critical in this area of social work practice. It provides a context in which to question, criticize, and change policies, laws, and practices that systematically prevent certain groups from full and equitable participation in society.</p>

According to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights , in more than 50 countries and in practically every world region&mdash;Africa, South and North America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East&mdash;more than 25 million people are actually considered as displaced people just as a result of violent conflicts and human rights violations.

                    <p>In addition to the assessment questions presented in the discussion on social work practice with immigrants, the following questions need to be a part of the assessment process with such individuals and their families.</p>

                    <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Assessing Emotional and Psychological States of Mind</p>
                    <p>The individual&rsquo;s responses to these questions will obviously affect the kind of support they will need during the resettlement process in Canada. It is well documented, for example, that as a result of their ordeal in getting to Canada in the first place, many such individuals will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indicators of PTSD may include recurring recollections of past trauma, feelings of sadness, nightmares, social withdrawal, and memory impairment (Chambers and Ganesan, 2005).</p>
                    <p>The impact of displacement is felt more acutely by children, women with small children or those who are heads of families, and disabled and elderly people. As part of the assessment process with refugees and displaced persons, it is especially important simply to listen closely to those individuals and to learn about their histories. Gaining trust over time is especially important when working with refugees and displaced persons.</p>
                    <p>It is also important at the beginning to gain some sense of the emotional and psychological state of mind of the individual concerned. Such an assessment can serve as a starting point from which to enlist various support mechanisms, in the schools and in the community at large, that will facilitate the resettlement process.</p>

                        <p><a class="ch-link" href="#" id="page-335"></a>A Canadian social worker employed by the Margaret Chisholm Resettlement Centre in Calgary provides front-line support for refugees of the civil war in Sudan who are anxious to settle into Canadian society and start a new life.</p>
                        <p>Wek Deng resided in the village of Nimule in southern Sudan with members of his family and neighbours. As an eight-year-old boy, he enjoyed playing with his friends and attending primary school.</p>
                        <p>During the fall of 1989, he could hear the sounds of armed conflict between forces loyal to the Government of Sudan and those under the leadership of General Omar al-Bashir.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">The Ravages of Civil War</p>
                        <p>Within a couple of weeks, the government forces marched into Deng&rsquo;s village, destroyed it, and killed several members of the community. Deng and a small group of friends were fortunate because they managed to flee the village and hide in the forest. However, they witnessed friends and family members die at the hands of the government troops.</p>
                        <p>Deng and his friends spent the next several years searching for a safe place to live. They walked over a thousand miles, at times dealing with terrible conditions in addition to a lack of food and water. They eventually made it to a refugee camp in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>Wek Deng spent five years in the refugee camp. Being separated from family was painful and he experienced nightmares as a result of the violence he and his friends had witnessed.</p>
                        <p>Despite the challenges of living in an overcrowded refugee camp that at times did not have enough water and food, Deng felt relatively safe. He took advantage of the schooling that was offered at the camp and recalled his father&rsquo;s stories that stressed the importance of getting a good education. He remembered his father telling him that &ldquo;the pen&rdquo; would be his most important tool.</p>
                        <p>With the help of the United Natiions, he managed to travel to Cairo, where he continued his education. Not surprisingly, Deng found himself challenged by living in a completely new environment. However, over time, he seemed to adjust quite well.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">First Cairo, Then Calgary</p>
                        <p>Wek Deng&rsquo;s first destination after leaving Cairo was Calgary, where he resided at the Margaret Chisholm Resettlement Centre.</p>
                        <p>The Margaret Chisholm Resettlement Centre provides temporary accommodation to newcomers as they begin the resettlement process in Calgary and assists them in overcoming initial obstacles in adjusting to a new country. The centre can accommodate up to 80 people. Government Assisted Refugees (GARs) who are destined for Calgary are brought from the airport to the centre, and they stay for up to 19 days until permanent accommodation is secured. The services provided by the centre for destined GARs include</p>

                            <li class="li--bullet-item">temporary accommodation;</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>During his stay at the resettlement centre, Deng was referred to a social worker employed by the organization. His social worker provided him with a list of resources that could help him begin to resettle in Canada. For example, Deng was interested in taking ESL classes.</p>
                        <p>The social worker helped Deng with some practical concerns such as opening a bank account, learning basic transportation routes using the bus and the C-train in Calgary, and very importantly, grocery shopping. The social worker also helped him get in touch with an immigrant-serving agency that provided different levels of ESL classes.</p>
                        <p>Deng stayed at the resettlement centre for three weeks. He was fortunate to have an uncle living in Calgary and was able to move in with him and his family. However, Deng kept the contact information of his first social worker, who reassured him that should he need any additional assistance, the worker would be available to help.</p>

                        <p>My work with newcomers is influenced by my own experience coming to Canada 15 years ago. Completing my PhD in social work was a response to what was happening with newcomers and a desire to work in the field where you are in a position to influence ideas, people, and policies.</p>
                        <p>Our programs at the Centre are designed to help immigrants and refugees find ways of settling into the system. Our job is to support them in every way possible. As newcomers working with newcomers, we are equipped with knowledge that helps us reinterpret their frustrations and contextualize them in order to respond appropriately to their needs. It takes people who have understood these experiences to be more empathetic, and this understanding better positions you to apply social work methods and approaches that make sense to the people with whom we are working. Our work is not just for agencies. It is for all of us&mdash;and for Calgary to become a better place, each of us has to play a role.</p>
                        <p>As a social worker, I bring elements and principles of justice, equity, fairness, and equality to my practice. Social work is working with people and practising social work principles. It&rsquo;s not just for service users, but also for peers and colleagues. We need to implement just policies within management itself and let it run through the organization. That is critical. If at a management level we have just-minded approaches to policy development, then that affects what happens on the ground. That for me is social work&mdash;changing people&rsquo;s mindsets, attitudes, and behaviours toward others and ensuring a justice approach to the work we do.</p>
                        <p>What surprised me most in my work with immigrants and refugees? First, I thought that once you get into this work you would be in a position to transform people&rsquo;s lives in a very short time. Then you realize that this is not the case. The second thing that surprised me is the lack of cohesion among social workers in agencies. So many people feel isolated in their field and practice because they are standing on principles they feel very strongly about and these social work values they possess are so different from those of others. Finally, you want to make things happen quickly, but realize you are up against powerful institutional forces. Social workers can only reach a solution to problems if we come together and see issues at a big-picture level.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">A Success Story</p>
                        <p>An immigrant youth at the Calgary Young Offender Centre was experiencing multiple challenges that others didn&rsquo;t know about. He sells drugs and brings money home so that his mom can help the family, feed them, and give them a place to sleep. This young man began telling me how he got involved in drugs, how he was beaten by the police, and how he landed in jail. Informally, I decided to mentor him and help build a support system for him.</p>
                        <p>I visited the young man and his mom. I talked to his soccer coach, and we went to the youth&rsquo;s home to talk about prospects for a soccer career. I advised him about his academics and he went back to school&mdash;he enrolled in college, began studying, and ended up with good grades. At one point he told me his GPA was 4.0! I mean, just look at his story, from being in jail to coming out of jail and saying, &ldquo;I need to change my life.&rdquo; He came to me for help because he was participating in a program at the Centre. We had this deep conversation and then he made his decision to change his life. You see a whole new person... not only him, but also his family.</p>
                        <p class="text--bold text--bold-grey">Words of Wisdom</p>
                        <p>What are some words of wisdom for social workers with aspirations to work with newcomers? First, I would tell students what attracted me to social work is the fact that it&rsquo;s one of the few professions that is value based, meaning that we must adhere to the values that guide our profession in our practice.</p>
                        <p>Second, sometimes the difference in how we treat newcomers lies in how we understand their experiences. Without that, it&rsquo;s difficult for you to provide meaningful support to people who turn to you for help. You are here to support newcomers and how you support them is critical. We need to do it in a way that respects these individuals.</p>
